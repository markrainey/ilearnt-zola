They never used to be talked about and people certainly wouldn't talk openly about the problems and challenges they are dealing with. This has started to change.\nSimon Sinek mentions a study that highlights the big difference even a short chat can have on someone's mental health and it advocates that a chat as short as 8 minutes can have an impact. He proposes highlighting the short time required it can address some of the reservations and obstacles to these conversations.\nHe says:\n\nBy mutually agreeing to an eight-minute time limit beforehand, both parties can engage in a meaningful exchange without overstaying their welcome. This ensures that the time spent together is both beneficial and respected.\n\nIf a friend sent me a message asking if \"I had 8 minutes\" I am sure I could make that time and I would also know that it is a conversation they really need to have.\nI also came across the following video from Norwich City Football Club that brilliantly highlights how sometimes it is hard to spot those who need support.

I have tried. \n\nI am not a big art lover but when I have viewed art I tend to be at the photo-realistic end as, to me, that shows the skill of the artist.\n\nA recent article made me reconsider the role and evolution of abstract art. It highlights five artists and then works through their journey to the abstract art that made them famous. In each case the artist was not just creating the art as they couldn't paint; they were all talented artists that went on a journey. You can see at each point how they are experimenting and how it ties to previous work.\nLooking at the early artwork of each of them, to me, they were nice but didn't really stand out. I wonder if this is what lead them to their journey. By experimenting to see where it went they could break away from the normal, stand out from the crowd. This is a bit like fashion. It is pushing moving away from the every day, the normal.\nI certainly learnt a new view of abstract art from the article. My preconceptions about it just being someone who couldn't paint have been expelled and each of their transitions is interesting to follow.\nHowever I still don't understand the appeal of abstract art.\nLinks\nThe Figurative-to-Abstract Art Pipeline\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/abstractart/","title":"Abstract art"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/advicewarnings/":{"body":"In the Knowledge Project podcast with Adam Robinson there is an interesting observation about warnings.\n\n\nHuman beings always ignore warnings.\n\nIt was stated in reference to a book that he had written for Warren Buffet. He shares a load of advice but some of them come with a warning. He states that most people when reading this would ignore the fact that there are warnings associated with them and take them as the truth.\nHe then goes on to make a very interesting observation:\n\nAll advice is a warning. All wisdom is a warning. If I say the best way to boil an egg is this, there's an implicit warning. If you don't boil it like that, the egg is not going to be as good as it could have been. If I say the best way to negotiate a contract is to always let them make the first offer. There's&nbsp;a&nbsp;warning.\n\nIt is not something I'd thought about before. When we receive advice we have a choice to take it or not. If we don't take it there is a risk that we are throwing away an opportunity to lean on someone else's knowledge and experience. However we might also be missing an opportunity to learn and find out the best way ourselves.\nIt is similar to the problem of local maxima with genetic algorithms. A genetic algorithm generates a result and evaluates it compared to previous results. If it is the \"best\" result then that becomes the next starting point. However this can create a problem called local maxima. It does not always find the best result and can get stuck at a lower point.\nIf you imagine a map grid where the height of every point reflects how good the result is. If you pick a starting point you can then look at all the squares next to you and move to the highest one. Using this approach you can navigate the map and will eventually end up at the top of a hill. The problem comes in that you will not move from the top of that hill as no squares around are higher. However this may not be the highest hill on the map - this is called a local maxima. \nThe way they solve this with genetic algorithms is through mutations - in our example this would be deciding to head off in a new direction even though it might not be the highest point.\nComing back to the advice and warnings, if everyone always takes a piece of advice and heeds the implicit warning then we could potentially get stuck at a local maxima - we wouldn't know if there is a better way to do things. If we always ignore the advice then we might find a better way or we may find a much worse way. \nSometimes we may want to ignore advice and just try things. We need to take into account the risks and the impact of being wrong. The advice to not touch a hot stove should probably be followed however the advice on the best way to learn to juggle can probably be safely ignored (although it may take you longer).\nLinks\nAdam Robinson #168\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/advicewarnings/","title":"Advice, warnings and genetic algorithms"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/aiassistededitor/":{"body":"Lex.page was one of the first AI assisted editors available. \n\nI have used it on and off for a few months and for some tasks it is pretty good - with some human intervention.

That’s alarm fatigue, and it’s a critical problem. A group of researchers studied five ICUs (intensive care units), treating 461 patients, for a month in 2013. There were almost 400,000 audible alarms logged in a month, which broke down to 187 audible alarms per bed per day. When everything is cause for alarm, nothing is cause for alarm. As we design early-warning systems, we should keep these questions in mind: \n\nWill the warning give us enough time to act effectively? (If not, why bother?) \nWhat rate of false positives can we expect? Our comfort with that level of false positives may, in turn, hinge on the relative cost of handling false positives versus the possibility of missing a real problem.\n\n\nI had two experiences of alarms during the last week.\nWe were using an office in a large building in Vienna. Suddenly the fire alarm went off. As we were only using the office for the day we checked whether it was a test or we had to leave the building. It was real so we all evacuated - along with hundreds of other people. \nBy the time we were outside the first fire engine had turned up. Within five minutes there were at least another nine appliances present. Fortunately they were able to deal with the situation and we could return after just over an hour. \nThis is an example of an alarm that should always be investigated. They are relatively rare and could involve a risk to life or significant damage to property. Yet, our previous experience of fire alarms meant that there was an element of doubt on whether we needed to act on it.\nThe second experience was at work. We have recently added a new monitoring tool that alerts us if data is missing. This is something that should never happen but if it happens we would like to know about it as quickly as possible.\nThe tool got deployed to an environment and we noticed that it was generating an alert every few hours saying there was an issue and then a short while later effectively cancelling that by saying everything was okay.\nIn investigating the cause we identified that it was due to one part of the workflow not reliably generating all the data required by the next step. This meant that sometimes it would not provide everything needed and hence the tool would generate an alert - even though there was no real underlying problem with the system being monitored.\nIn this instance we were getting frequent alerts of something important but they were wrong. However this meant that we also didn't know when a \"real\" alert was generated as it was lost in the noise. This made the tool effectively useless as this alert would be missed. In the short term we have disabled the monitoring tool while the issue is fixed.\nAlarms are important and useful but there must be a high signal to noise ratio otherwise there is a risk they will be ignored and not achieve their aim.\nLinks\nUpstream: How to solve problems before they happen\nAs an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/alarmnoise/","title":"Alarms lost in the noise"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/altcontroldelete/":{"body":"The background to why the famous \"three finger salute\" was chosen to be so difficult to do.\n\nLinks\nThe secret history of Ctrl+Alt+Del\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/altcontroldelete/","title":"The secret history of Ctrl+Alt+Del"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/alternativebucketlist/":{"body":"I have never formally made a bucket list.

In the worst case scenario they proposed that they would potentially offer a couple of potential options but even then would not propose a specific answer/solution.\nFor me, that is a really poor approach. I want people I am working with to challenge what I say - to at least get me to justify choices and decisions. Similarly they should expect me to challenge decisions they propose.

It means I can ask anything and it doesn't matter if it is something I should already know or that doesn't make sense. Often this will lead to a discussion and something new will be learnt - or we may have overlooked something.\nMy favourite example of this was by the scientist Richard Feynman. He accidentally identified a major flaw in the design of a nuclear plant just by not being afraid to ask the stupid question.\n\nI took mechanical drawing when I was in school, but I am not good at reading blueprints. So they start to explain it to me, because they think I am a genius. Now, one of the things they had to avoid in the plant was accumulation. So they had problems like when there's an evaporator working, which is trying to accumulate the stuff, if the valve gets stuck or something like that and too much stuff accumulates, it'll explode. So they explained to me that this plant is designed so that if any one valve gets stuck nothing will happen. It needs at least two valves everywhere.\nThen they explain how it works. The carbon tetrachloride comes in here, the uranium nitrate from here comes in here, it goes up and down, it goes up through the floor, comes up through the pipes, coming up from the second floor, bluuuuurp - going through the stack of blueprints, down-up-down-up, talking very fast, explaining the very, very complicated chemical plant.\nI'm completely dazed. Worse, I don't know what the symbols on the blueprint mean! There is some kind of a thing that at first I think is a window. It's a square with a little cross in the middle, all over the damn place. I think it's a window, but no, it can't be a window, because it isn't always at the edge.

So, in order to find out whether it's a valve or not, I take my finger and I put it down on one of the mysterious little crosses in the middle of one of the blueprints on page number 3, and I say, “What happens if this valve gets stuck?\" figuring they're going to say, “That's not a valve, sir, that's a window.\"\nSo one looks at the other and says, “Well, if that valve gets stuck -- \" and he goes up and down on the blueprint, up and down, the other guy up and down, back and forth, back and forth, and they both look at each other and they tchk, tchk, tchk, and they turn around to me and they open their mouths like astonished fish and say, “You're absolutely right, sir.\"\nSo they rolled up the blueprints and away they went and we walked out.

It was performed using three tape drives running one after the other and took all night to run. It needed that many drives as there was too much to fit on one. There were hundreds of tapes that would rotated in a set plan and each night I would take the latest backups home so we had at least one set \"off site\" and place the previous ones back in the fire safe.\nIt was a boring process occasionally made interesting by a failed backup. If it failed we would just wait for the next night to run - which usually worked - as it would take too long to run during the day.\nI had done selective restores of files for people who had accidentally deleted them but as storage was expensive I had never done a full restore of a drive. \nOne day things didn't go quite as planned. All the drives were connected to a single server that the whole company used. On this day one of the drives failed. We had a network engineer who looked after these sort of things so it fell into his lap. Obviously as it would involve restoring data it would also need my input.\n\nThe restore took a few hours to run so we informed everyone and they waited. Just before it was due to finish it failed - definitely something you don't want to happen. At this point we informed the management, who clearly were not very happy about the situation, and they decided everyone else may as well go home as it was already mid-afternoon. \nThis left just the two of us to fix it.\nThe next three or four runs failed as well. By now it was late in the evening and things were looking very serious. If we could not restore the data then there was a good chance that it could be terminal for the company as key files and data would be lost.\nTo take our minds off this, I had my unicycle in the office (don't ask) and he had his skateboard so we spent some of the waiting time unicycling or skateboarding around all the corridors in the building. Every couple of hours we would check to see if the restore worked and if not we would kick off another one.\nWe gave the backup one last run and it finally worked and we managed to go home at about 1am - extremely relieved and very tired. If it hadn't worked I am really not sure what the next steps would have been.\nShortly after that I passed on the backup responsibilities to someone else and I never want to go through that again.\nI learned to never assume that something is going to work - always test it.

Most of them turn out to be just a button you click that slings together a bunch of random words that are meant to then become a prompt to generate ideas.\n\nThe Product Idea Prompts site by Jakob Greenfeld seems to be much more than this. The prompts it generates are not random words but calls to action - tasks to do that will then generate ideas. As an example:\nHave a look at the currently trending GitHub repositories. Is there a way to turn one of them into a profitable business? (For example, by offering a done-for-you solution.)\nand it has a link to the trending repositories on Github. The next prompts might be to visit a certain website and identify pain points or to think about something specific.\nAnother site that goes beyond just random words is IdeasAI which uses the GPT-3 AI platform to generate ideas for businesses that the community can then vote on. Some of the ideas have been done before, some are completely off the wall and some are very vague however there are potentially some nuggets in there.\nAt the moment the most voted for idea for this month is:\nA startup on the App Store that helps users manage their apps, promote and sell them, and help users find updates and new features.\nThis is very vague but could prompt you to look at ways to improve the app store experience - maybe an independent review site or improved way of filtering and searching?\nAs both sites say, they are idea generators and I personally would just use them as prompts and not expect a fully fledged idea.

This was a pretty big move and a complete culture change - although as I was only four, I didn't know this at the time. \nLondon is obviously a city whereas Devon, in the south west of England, is countryside, moorland and some of the best beaches in the UK; almost a complete opposite.\nGrowing up here meant that I could see fields and sheep from the window every day. At the end of the road I could see the sand dunes of Braunton Burrows in the distance. The nearest beach was ten minutes away. My favourite beach, Woolacombe, with three miles of sand was only about twenty minutes away.\nWhen I was growing up I thought all this was normal and the problem with \"normal\" is that it is easy to take it for granted.\nWhen I left university I got a job to the north of London and have lived there ever since - there were very few computer jobs in Devon and remote working was not an option back then. My parents still live in the same house I grew up in - in fact I am writing this from there as I am visiting at the moment.\nIt is only after I moved away that things changed. I developed a new \"normal\" and realised how different my growing up was and how lucky I was having all the beaches and countryside on my doorstep. I really appreciate everything when I am there now.\nIt is also easy to take other things for granted. It was only once I had kids that I grew to appreciate everything my parents did. At the time you sort of don't realise all the small things they do to make a family function. You look back and remember all the big things like holidays and important events but you forget all the tasks like washing and cleaning, the making of packed lunches, the driving to football matches that actually made all the difference.\nI am fortunate that both my parents are still alive and I definitely don't take that for granted. It is why I am writing this from Devon - I am making sure that I spend time with them. Yes, I will probably go for some walks and visit a beach but it is more about the small things - the spending time with them and talking - not forgetting these little details and experiences and not taking things for granted.\nAnd then you come to my family. It is easy to take a spouse for granted. There is a lot my wife does that I don't see or don't take notice of of. She has to put up with me for a start.\nIn September my daughter will be heading to university. It is easy at the moment to forget this and assume that it is a long time away and not make the effort to savour the time we have with her before she moves away. It is easy to take the current situation for granted. I have to stop and think and make sure that I really appreciate what I have and make a conscious effort to focus on it.\nBeware of the \"normal\" and what it causes you to forget - the small details and the important things in life.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/bewareofthenormal/","title":"Beware of the normal"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/blackmirrortesting/":{"body":"Nearly every technology that has been developed has been used for both good and bad.

This leads to a power cut across Europe that lasts days and the storyline of how they track down the cause and the perpetrators. \n\nIt highlights how much society now relies on electricity and the impact of its removal.

It can become very daunting even in deciding where to start.\n\nIt can also apply to skills you want to learn. From Skip the Line by James Altucher:\n\nAny skill worth getting good at is really a collection of microskills. And to get truly great at something, you need to get good at those microskills.\n\nThe benefit of breaking things down into smaller parts can be seen in lots of different areas.\nSoftware development is all about breaking things down into chunks, whether they are classes, methods, functions, modules, layers; lots of different bits with different levels of abstraction. If the chunks are broken down and identified properly this can allow work on multiple parts at the same time by different people or even different teams. It can allow the development of something that originally seemed impossible.\n\nThe project I have been on for about six years started as an idea. We came up with a theoretical way of making it work and then we prototyped it. That worked and so we put together a team to develop it. They started with the core functionality and we agreed to put off certain functionality and problems for a later date. We were sure we could solve them and we considered them when working on the current functionality but we didn't get blocked by them.\nIf we look at what we have developed now compared to what we thought we needed to develop we would have thought it impossible.\nThe art of cooking is breaking things down into smaller steps. By following each step even a beginner cook can usually make something edible. A dish that seems complex and difficult can normally be broken down into the steps needed to produce it.\nDave Brailsford was put in charge of a cycling team. He built the team ethos around something\nreferred to as the “Aggregation of marginal gains.” \n\n“The whole principle came from the idea that if you broke down everything you could think of that goes into riding a bike, and then improve it by 1 percent, you will get a significant increase when you put them all together.”\n\nBy breaking everything down into smaller areas and then improving each area he was able to transform that cycling team to a team of winners.\nSports people do training drills for specific skills. Footballers practice dribbling, shooting and other skills to improve each aspect of their game. Basketball players may focus on shooting or defending; golfers may practice their driving and putting. In each case that practice and small improvements can transform their game.\nIt is not always the big things that make the biggest difference. Sometimes it is all the small things that can make the impossible possible.\nLinks\nSkip the Line\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/breakingthingsdown/","title":"Breaking things down"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/buildingacollectionofhabits/":{"body":"I have followed the writing of David Perell for a while and recently listened to some of the podcasts he has recorded. Somehow I stumbled on one with Daniel Gross. Towards the end of the podcast David mentions his aim to build the largest collection of habits he can.\n\nHe defined a habit as something you do and don't have to think about and gave the example of going to the gym. If he experiments now to find what works for him and makes it a habit, as life becomes busy or changes he can continue it without having to think or make conscious decisions - it becomes easy/easier. So in his world it is a series of experiments to identify the key habits he can incorporate to improve his life with the minimal amount of conscious effort going forward.\nThis made me think about how I could introduce habits or any I already had. \nI tend to be the first person up in the house each morning. I take the time before everyone else appears to catch up on a whole bunch of updates from websites, check the news headlines and most importantly read a section from the bible. For two and a half years I have been reading it every day, only about 10 minutes each time, and I aim to finish it each time at the end of the year. It is something I do every day as part of my routine, a habit.\nFitness would be a good one for me to identify as a habit - definitely an area for improvement. I have tried using an exercise bike and it worked for a while but then it became a chore. It helped that I left everything ready next to it so it was as easy as possible to use it however I didn't really enjoy it. Currently I am doing a 20-30 minute walk before work - see my previous post - and it is great to get out but it is not really stretching me physically. I play walking football, which is much more strenuous than it sounds, however this is just once a week so has some, but minimal impact on my overall fitness. Maybe I will try the bike again but try and make it enjoyable in some way.\nHave a think about what habits you could introduce to build a collection that will improve your life.\nLinks\nDaniel Gross: Dreams and Determination\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/buildingacollectionofhabits/","title":"Building a collection of habits"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/butterflyeffect/":{"body":"The butterfly effect famously states that the flapping of the wings of a butterfly somewhere in the world can impact the weather on the other side of the world - a small change can have a huge impact over time.\n\nWhen I was at university a friend was studying engineering and decided to base his project on the impact of chaos. This was in the \"early days\" of the term chaos entering the mainstream. He used measuring a guitar case to demonstrate fractal dimensions, plotted 3d charts of his data and also built a double pendulum to demonstrate chaotic activity. He attached different colour LED lights to it and then set it off in a dark room. With our natural persistence of vision it was a pretty cool effect. He was able to very clearly show that a very small difference in the starting position led to a completely unpredictable outcome.\nThis brings me nicely to a book I recently finished called Upstream by Dan Heath. The theme of the book is making changes upstream of something to impact the outcome. This could be preventative approaches to medicine for example, where preventing a health issue is significantly cheaper and easier than dealing with the health complications further down the line. He also gives other examples including education.\nHe explains nicely how to look at the difference between upstream and downstream actions:\n\nDownstream actions react to problems once they’ve occurred. Upstream efforts aim to prevent those problems from happening.\n\nSolving everything upstream all sounds wonderful however there are a few issues he highlights. \nIt can be very difficult to justify taking an upstream action in some cases as you may not be able to determine what the result would have been without the intervention. This makes measuring the impact of the intervention difficult and in a lot of cases impossible.\nIt could also be the specific actions of one party that make a difference but the benefit is seen by a different party. This can lead to no-one wanting to invest in the upstream action as they will have to justify their investment and the impact it had. It would not be directly of benefit to them.\nOne of the things that ties most cases together is that a potentially small change can have a massive difference further down the line - the butterfly effect again.\nI've also seen this in the business environment. At one company I worked for they had two main departments. Each department had a CTO (Chief Technology Officer). The CTO of our department was not afraid to stand up for what he believed or needed. This eventually led to him being effectively forced to leave.\nThe company then appointed the other CTO as head over both departments. The culture completely changed. I left after about a month but the impact was way more severe. Shortly after I left they had a string of resignations - thirteen people left on thirteen consecutive days. People were discussing with each other which day they were going to resign.\nThe seemingly small change of replacing the CTO had repercussions on that company that took a long time to recover from and also had a massive impact on those remaining. \nThe key takeaway is be conscious of decisions you make, things you say, actions you take - whether in business or life in general - as what might appear to be small could have a massive impact on the future of yourself and those around you.\nLinks\nUpstream by Dan Heath \nAs an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/butterflyeffect/","title":"The upstream butterfly effect"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/capturingmemories/":{"body":"A PhD student has created a way to capture conversations with hospice patients that their relatives can play back and listen to at any time later.\n\nIt dawned on me a while ago that a lot of knowledge and memories \"disappear\" when someone passes away.

His whole thing in giving that to me so early was that so many people are so scared to answer that question honestly, for fear that if they don't achieve whatever the answer is, they'll let themselves and those around them down. But if you do have the confidence and the conviction to answer that question honestly, maybe you won't achieve what you set out to, but you'll get really far down the road just for having tried.\n\nThis is quite a liberating, and unnatural way for me at least, way to think. What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail? And if you don't achieve it at least you will have made progress on it.\nI have a side project and I have hit a bit of a roadblock. I need to do a reasonable amount of work on it and at the moment motivation is a little lacking. Part of that is the daunting prospect of achieving what my head is telling me is success - releasing an app and getting lots of people to use it.\nIf I knew I could not fail then I would just plough on and release what I already have then work on it again to improve it.\nHowever there is another way to frame this. Maybe what I need to do is move my definition of success so I cannot fail. Maybe I should set my sights on releasing the app and just getting one person to use it. Given the aim of the application, the most important people for me to use it are my parents and I am sure if I released something they would use it - regardless of how well it works or how nice it looks.\nFor me, this is a much easier target to hit and I know I could do this without failing.\nLinks\nDown A Rabbit Hole with Seth Godin - Simon Sinek/\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/couldnotfail/","title":"What would you attempt if you knew you could not fail?"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/crazysocks/":{"body":"This is a great article about a small business that is growing rapidly and run with a smile on their faces.

I was listening to one on creativity and mentioned that creativity is effectively taking existing elements and rearranging them in novel ways. It highlighted that there are two parts to creativity -  creating/discovery and linear/implementation. \n\nThe first mode, creating discovery, involves exploring different configurations. This is the mode when you blue sky new ideas and think about creative solutions. It is best suited to when you are relaxed, potentially even sleepy.\nThe second mode is referred to as linear mode. This mode is a separate state and is suited to the implementation of things - possibly numerical work or learning - where it requires much more focus. This is best suited to when you are more alert.\nMost people transition through these two states of alertness through the course of the day and different people have different times when they are in each mode. Being conscious of your level of alertness means that you can tune when to do different types of work and in turn be more successful as they align with the best mode for your state of alertness.\nFor me, I am most alert first thing in the morning so that is the best time for me to get my head down and get stuff done. In the afternoon I have less energy and so it is a better time for creative thinking. \nWhen is the best time for you for each mode and how could you utilize that?\nLinks\nHow to be more creative\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/creativitymodes/","title":"Creativity modes"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/cuckooskleinbottle/":{"body":"When I was at university, a long time ago, one of the books I really enjoyed was \"The Cuckoo's Egg\" by Clifford Stoll.\n\nIt tracks the true story of an astrophysicist at Berkeley who is asked to have a look at a minor discrepancy in some billing for computer time. Over the next couple of years he ends up tracking a hacker to Germany including the involvement of various US Government agencies. It reads like a thriller. Even though the technology aspect is a little old now - it is still well worth a read.\nI have read that book so many times that I had to buy a new copy just to get a new dustcover as the old one is so worn out.\nIt turns out that the author of the book, Cliff Stoll, now has a side line business - Acme Klein Bottles - and is selling Klein bottles that can be shipped around the world. A klein bottle is a one-sided surface zero volume bottle - basically think of a bottle where the neck is very long then passed back through the side of the bottle and out through the bottom.\nAnyway, I decided to order a \"Baby\" Klein bottle. As part of the ordering process it asks if there is any message if it is a gift. I said it was a gift for myself so surprise me!\nWithin 24 hours I had received a personal email from Cliff reminiscing about the days of 300 baud modems and detailing how he was going to cycle to the post office later that day to post it. It also promised a subsequent email with photos of the bottle and it's packing etc.\nThe promised email turned up shortly after with 19 photos! including pictures of the notes and pictures he had written/drawn on the bottle, invoice and box as well as pictures of the great man himself holding the bottle and the parcel.\n\nThe bottle arrived safely and now sits beside my laptop on my desk. The package also included some pages of notes about Klein bottles and various other things, an invoice with a message in a logarithmic spiral and an old IBM 360 control card with a personal message on the back to use as a bookmark for the book.\n\nIt would have been very easy for him to just take a bottle, package it and send it off. However he made the whole process and experience special - going way above and beyond - making it personal and something to remember and talk about.\nSo, thank you Cliff for making it special and also for the book that started me on this.\nP.S I hope you enjoyed the eclipse!\nLinks\nAcme Klein Bottle\nThe Cuckoo's Egg\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/cuckooskleinbottle/","title":"The Cuckoo's Klein Bottle"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/culturalcontributor/":{"body":"When we recruit people we are obviously looking at their ability to perform the role on offer but we are also looking at how well they will work with the team.\n\nWe are very proud of the culture we have created in the team - as an example, two people in the past left and then came back as they couldn't find anywhere else like it. It is so important to us that we have rejected candidates as we didn't think they would fit in with the team and the culture we have despite having the ability to do the role.\nIn the past I would have called this seeing if they are a cultural fit. However a recent interview got me to re-evaluate that, or at least the wording:\n\nThere is such a thing as fitting the culture. But what I love is this terminology of seeing someone as a fit, it absolutely has a pernicious side to it. You are a square. We have a place for a square over here. Square peg square hole. Versus contribution, which is a growth mind set with its contribution, which is we are growing. We're expanding, we're amplifying, and we need whatever it is you have to help us amplify. It goes back to Frank Lloyd Wright, do you fit? Will you be the square peg that I need in this square hole at this moment to serve me? Or are you going to do something that's going to challenge me and make me uncomfortable? Jim Henson, Walt Disney, and look what we can build together that I couldn't do without you. That's,  cultural contribution. I really, really like that for us to think of someone as a potential cultural contributor, rather than a fit.\nWhat you bring that we don't have? How is your voice different? How is your personality different? \n\nI completely agree with this. We want people who don't just fit; they add and contribute to the culture we are building. Evaluating the people we currently have I think that is the case for each of them. They all bring something different - and definitely some bring things others don't (in a good way)!\nIn the book Unreasonable Hospitality the author, Will Guidara, talks about his interview process and how he used to have a structured flow and now uses a more conversational approach. He says:\n\nYou simply have enough of a conversation that you can get to know the person a little bit. Do they seem curious and passionate about what we’re trying to build? Do they have integrity; are they someone I can respect? Is this someone I can imagine myself— and my team— happily spending a lot of time with?\n\nAgain the emphasis here is on culture and personality rather than the ability.\nWe still have some structure to our first interview as there are a set of topics we want to touch on but it forms more of a checklist than a rote series of questions. We aim for the interview to be as much of a conversation as possible with both parties driving the flow. We look for something we refer to as \"the spark\". We want to see their eyes light up when they answer certain things, we want them to be passionate about something and enjoy what they do. They need to be able to communicate well but also have some sense of humour. We want it to be a fun place to work.\nI think the answers to the three questions given above are vitally important and align with our views and how we identify the right candidate. \nLinks\nDesigning the Future with Brian Collins/\nUnreasonable Hospitality: The Remarkable Power of Giving People More Than They Expect/\nAs an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/culturalcontributor/","title":"Cultural fit versus contributor"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/culturebehaviour/":{"body":"Andrew Cherrie is the pastor of Home Church.

Without wanting to incriminate myself, there have been some questionable decisions made by the management in the past which have meant it has been very difficult to hold others  accountable for their later actions when a precedence has been set. \nThe behaviour of some of the people involved has also been questionable. The way they have conducted themselves with respect to both their staff and customers have set a precedence for the culture of the company. It may start with a small infraction but this can quickly lead to larger and larger infractions justified by the previous ones.\nIn the London office where I currently work our leadership team have worked very hard to build the culture. We have tried to build a culture and environment where we would want to work.

The results were impressive.\n\nBarnes’ rules around meetings and respecting people’s time were echoed in Japan when Microsoft introduced a FDW trial. They had three rules.

It was at least 100 years old and was clearly from a previous era. The décor was a little bit dated and it felt like it could do with a bit of an update. Parking was on the road outside and was tricky to get a space. Hallways were dark and furniture was old fashioned.\nHowever, the staff were friendly, the room was really clean and the location was excellent. And it was relatively cheap. It had some character that you don't get in the modern chains of hotels.\nI definitely would not class it as excellent however as a place to stay it did the job. I would actually recommend someone to stay there in future if they want a cheap, clean hotel in a good location. If they want something special or more modern then maybe not.\nWhich brings me to the question, what makes a good hotel?\nI think there are a few factors - firstly, is it clean? I don't care what level of hotel it is, I expect the room and facilities to be clean - especially nowadays. \nSecondly, does it do what I need? If I just want somewhere cheap to stay then does it work? Is it near where I need to be? Or if I want a romantic place to stay does it meet expectations? This last criteria changes depending on the role the hotel is expected to fulfil.\nAnd lastly, can I get a good nights sleep? This is a factor of the bed, the room and the noise.

Because a hundred people that love you will tell their friends about you, and then they'll tell their friends, they'll tell their friends, and they become your marketing.

He says:\n\nNo matter what framework or method your management thinks they are applying, learn to work this way:\n\nProduce running, tested, working, integrated software every two weeks, every week. Build your skills until you can create a new fully operational version every day, twice a day, multiple times a day.\nKeep the design of that software clean. As it grows, the design will tend to become complex and crufty. Resist and reverse this tendency consciously, refactoring in tiny continuous steps, all the time, so that your rate of progress is as steady and consistent as possible.\nUse the current increment of software as the foundation for all your conversations with your product leadership and management. Speak in terms of what’s ready to go, and in terms of what they’d like you to do next.\n\n\nHe recommends starting with Extreme Programming but he also says that it is not the be all and end all and developers should \"stay alert at all times for signs of all the other things you need\".\nWe have just finished a phase of a project where \"Agile\" was used - this was clearly not a success and the \"golden path\" guaranteed to deliver. \nWe are now looking to change the way we work for the next phase.\nLinks\nDevelopers Should Abandon Agile\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/developersshouldabandonagile/","title":"Abandoning the baggage of Agile"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/devonhotdesk/":{"body":"I have been visiting my parents in Devon recently and working from there.

I ended up supporting them almost by accident. Our family were not a football family but we sat down to watch the 1977 FA Cup Final between Liverpool and Manchester United. Red was my favourite colour so, for some reason, I picked the team playing in white which was Liverpool that day. Liverpool lost 2-1 but my love of football and the team stem from that day. My son is now also a big Liverpool fan.\nWe were fortunate enough to go to Anfield earlier in the season. Unfortunately it was the game Liverpool lost 2-1 to Leeds.\nWhen it was announced that Roberto Firmino and James Milner would be leaving at the end of the season I wanted to get tickets for the last home game of the season against Aston Villa. I tried but couldn't find any. I check a bunch of official sites - the club and partners - but no luck.\nThen one day on the off chance I check one of them again - Sportsbreaks - and they had two tickets available that I quickly snapped up. It included a night in a hotel after the game - the \"Knowsley Inn and Lounge\". \nParking near Anfield on match day is also not always fun so decided to try JustPark for the first time and booked a parking slot on someone's drive nearby. This worked really well and will use this option again in future.\nWe did the Boot Room hospitality directly from Liverpool  for the Leeds match. That consisted of a meal and then tickets at the Anfield Road end. The meal was okay and the seats were okay but it was the only way to get tickets at the time.\nThese tickets we bought gave us hospitality access to the Code Lounge. This included a free drink at half time but there was no pre-match meal. You could buy drinks and a standard burger or hotdog if you wanted. I much preferred this as it was a nicer environment and we didn't need the meal - we were more focussed on the match.\nBefore the match we saw the bus arrive and then Mark Lawrenson, the ex-Liverpool defender and TV pundit, spoke for about five minutes. We then took our seats in the L11 section. Excellent view in line with the goal - quite near to the away fans. They were quite loud but it added to the atmosphere. The seats were padded and so much more comfortable than last time.\n\nAs for the match itself, the atmosphere was really good even if it didn't go as we planned. Villa missed a penalty and then scored. We had a goal disallowed (wrongly according to most of the pundits).\nAfter about 70 minutes Roberto Firmino and James Milner came on for their last appearance at Anfield. The atmosphere went up a notch. About a minute before the final whistle, Mo Salah crossed the ball and Bobby nipped in and finished at the near post. The place erupted. What an incredible way to sign off - \"Pass the ball to Bobby and he will score\".\nIt finished 1-1 so it wasn't quite the complete fairy tale but I was so glad we were there. Something to talk about for years to come.\nAfter the game there was a guard of honour for the four players leaving at the end of the season - Firmino, Milner, Ox and Keita. After that all the players, staff and their families did a \"lap of thanks\" around the pitch. I found that quite emotional - especially the send off the two main players got from the kop.\n\nLeon, my son, has always loved the way Firmino plays and has had his shirt and even a painted picture on the wall of his bedroom. I have always admired Milner due to his whole professional approach to the game and his attitude. He may not be the most skilful player but he is someone who is always giving everything. Both of them thrive from making those around them better - and that for me is such an incredible trait.\nThank you James and Bobby for everything.\nAnd now on to next season ...\nAs a side note, the Google Pixel 7 Pro 30x zoom was pretty impressive.

We have an office and team there and we needed to discuss some aspects of upcoming work.\nWe have a running joke that when we go to Vienna we must eat Apple Strudel, with vanilla sauce. \n\nLast time one of  the others was in Vienna was taken by a friend to have strudel and was given something completely different. His disappointment was immense.\nOn our trip we were able to eat strudel twice. The first time was at a venue (I won't name them) that had good reviews and was one of THE places to eat it in Vienna. It was very ornate with smart waiters and waitresses. With this in mind, our expectations were very high. We were served strudel but these expectations weren't met. It was a little overcooked and lacked flavour. The service was brilliant but the product wasn't as good.\nOur second strudel was at a cafe opposite the Opera House. The strudel here was excellent and exceeded our expectations - which had admittedly been tempered by our experience the previous day. The difference between the two was huge.\nWe also had a running joke about the mysterious \"Gates G\" at the airport in Vienna. We mostly flew British Airways and these would always come into \"Gates D\". This section of the airport was very old fashioned, the food was not great and there was nothing to do. One day we followed the signs to this other area and were greeted by a more up-to-date airport experience.\nDue to the pandemic we had not flown to Vienna for about three years. Unknown to us, until we landed, the dreary \"Gates D\" area had been updated and refurbished. It was now significantly improved. We visited \"Gates G\" for old times sake and found that it was actually worse than this new area now. It is still just an area of an airport and doesn't compare to most others we have visited but our expectations of both had changed due to our previous level of expectations and we appreciated the area much more than we would have done had we visited it for the first time.\nYes, these both might seem like trivial - and probably odd - examples. However it demonstrates the impact that expectations can have on our experience of something. In the case of the strudel, if we had not had it before then we would probably have really liked the first one but we had already set our expectations. For the second one, our previous expectations meant that the changes made impacted how we perceived both areas - one better and one worse.\nThis can happen in all areas of life. We read a good review of something or somewhere and our expectations are high. Similarly, we read a bad review and our expectations are set very low. When we actually experience the item or the place we compare it with our pre-set expectations and our enjoyment of it will be influenced by this comparison.\nA number of times I have been surprised by something where I was not expecting it. In a lot of cases this was due to having low expectations that were exceeded. Going forward, are you setting your expectations too low or, probably more importantly, too high and is this impacting how you enjoy things?\nLinks\nGerstner K. u. K.

It is such a simple thing to do and I think we will find it will bring us even closer together - despite the distance.\nThanks Gerhard for the idea!\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/familybreakfast/","title":"A remote family breakfast"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/fatherlywisdom/":{"body":"Today my daughter turns 18 years old. Wow, time flown has by.\nOne of her friends is putting together a present that includes letters from her friends and family. This gave me the wonderful opportunity to write her a letter reminiscing about her life and telling her how proud of her I am - and also giving her advice for the future.\n\nThis is the advice I gave her:\n\nFirst and foremost, have fun and enjoy life. \nDon't take stupid risks, take sensible risks.\nDon't be afraid to make mistakes as this is how we learn. \nAlways work hard - doing so will give you an edge over nearly everyone else. However remember there is life outside work so it is about having a balance - work should not dominate everything you do.\nDo your best - How many times have you heard me say this? You can never do more than that. \nIt is very easy to forget your health as you get older and life gets busy - look at me. Sometimes it takes a conscious effort to stay healthy. \nDon't care what others think - ignore unkind words, wear what you like (I may still get to comment on this), stand up to peer pressure when you need to and ignore social media comments.\nLove will find you when it is ready - there is no need to rush to find it.\nAlways look to help others, no matter how small the task or difference you make. It is an easy way to change lives and will come back to bless you later.\nRely on God - He is always with you.\nBuild great friendships - they will help you navigate and enjoy life and be there through the highs and lows. \nBeing me, I have to mention reading books. For non-fiction - decades of study compressed into something that takes less than 24 hours to consume. For fiction it can take you to another world and another life. \nLife is full of choices. I once worked with someone who said when he has a choice to make he will pick the one that is the most interesting. Maybe this is the way to do it, maybe it is pick the one that is the most fun or the one that is the most challenging. You will find a way to navigate life.\nWhatever you do try and keep smiling.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/fatherlywisdom/","title":"Fatherly wisdom"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/favouritebooks/":{"body":"The top shelf of books in my study has the books that have had the most impact on me or that I have enjoyed reading the most.\n\nSome of the books on my \"top shelf\" currently:\nComputing\nCLR via C# by Jeffrey Richter - When I was a C# developer I read the whole of this book before I started any interview round. It definitely helped me get a number of jobs.\nDesigning Data Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann - A very well written book that explains most of the key concepts and approaches for designing distributed systems. We recommend all our engineers read this at some point.\nThe Cuckoo's Egg by Clifford Stoll - \nI read this when I was studying computer science at university. It tells the story of how the author tracked down some hackers in the early days of the internet and eventually located them in Germany. It reads a bit like a thriller. Read it numerous times.\nChristian\nThe Miracle of a Daddy's Hug  by John Burns - \nJohn Burns came and spoke at our church many years ago and I bought the book shortly after. I read it before my daughter was born and it completely changed the way I interact with her. She knows she can get a \"Daddy's Hug\" when she needs one.\nIncreasing Your Personal Capacity  by Eddie Windsor - Another author who spoke at our church. This had a huge impact on my life. It's basic premise is that you need to increase your personal capacity (whatever that may mean to you in a given context) to enable you to handle more. \nLove Does by Bob Goff - Bob Goff is an amazing human being with so many stories. He spoke at a men's event at our church and spent the lunchtime cleaning police vans outside as they would remember it, rather than having lunch. \nThe Case for Christ by Lee Strobel - I read this book around the time I became a Christian. I had a lot of questions and the author addressed some of them as he also went from being a sceptic to being a Christian. The other books in the series are also good.\nThe Bible - I have to include this. I have read it numerous times including the whole of New Testament (Message translation) before I became a Christian. \nBusiness\nMaverick and The Seven-Day Workweek by Ricardo Semler - When I was involved in starting a consultancy these two books had an influence on the culture we tried to create. We didn't go as far as the author but it certainly changed the way we did things in some areas.\nStart With Why by Simon Sinek - A lot of people have seen the Simon Sinek TED talk. The book takes that and expands on it - saying that companies that succeed focus on the \"why\" before anything else.\nThe Innovator's Solution by Clayton Christensen - It maybe a little dated now as it doesn't seem to take into account other drivers especially for consumer goods however it is still a ground breaking work.\nUnreasonable Hospitality by Will Guidara - I had seen a video about this and read the book. One of the best books I have read recently and completely changed my view of what customer service/hospitality is and going above and beyond. So many great stories and I definitely recommend this book.\nThe Checklist Manifesto by Atul Gawande - A book with a simple premise that made me rethink how the simple checklist can be used and why it should be used.\nThe Goal by Eli Goldratt - A classic business book that brilliantly illustrates how to address bottlenecks in processes. A very good read of a subject that could have been very dull. Given this book away before.\nLife\nOrbiting The Giant Hairball by Gordon MacKenzie - \nA fun book to read as the approach to presentation is so different. Lots of random things to think about.\nThe Last Lecture  by Randy Pausch - \nI re-read this book every now and again to remind me what life is about. A lecturer knew he was dying of terminal cancer and gave a lecture to remember.\nThe Art of Possibility  by Benjamin Zander - \nThe author is a really fun speaker to watch who has a very positive outlook on life. This book encourages the reader to look for the possibilities, rather than the problems, in life. I have given away copies of this book.\nTake the Day Off by Robert Morris - It is very easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of the world. This book, based on the Bible, encourages the reader to take a whole day off each week - or at a minimum ensure you rest well. Another book I have gifted.\nQuiet by Susan Cain - I am an introvert and this was one of those books where you read it and go \"that's me\" and \"that makes sense\" and \"now I know why I do that\". So many insights that align with me as a person.\nFiction\nWargames  by David Bischoff -\nThe film of this name was a formative film when I was growing up and the book is not bad either (as usual there are some differences between the book and the film).\nSnow Crash by Neal Stephenson - I used to read a lot more Sci-fi than I do now and this was one of my favourites, with so many different ideas to think about.\nTomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin - A very well written story with excellent characters - really enjoyed getting lost in it.\nThe Rabbit Factor by Antti Tuomainen - I wondered whether to put this one in or not. It is a really fun read, a sort of thriller with humour, with lots of very unexpected twists and turns.\nThe Martian by Andy Weir - Probably my favourite science fiction book of recent times. So well written and researched and the film does an excellent job of dramatising it.\nReady Player One by Ernest Cline - A great science fiction book with lots of easter eggs and references to the 1980s for those who lived through that era. Unfortunately the follow up was so bad I only managed about 1/3 of it.\nFree Country by George Mahood - This is one of the funniest travel books I have read. The first part where they start at Lands End with nothing is hilarious.\nThe Book of Beginnings by Sally Page - I keep thinking about this book. The characters are amazing and the writing is brilliant - you can picture it as unfolds and you feel their emotions.\nSport\nBotham by Ian Botham - I grew up in the 1980s supporting Somerset and England. My hero was Ian Botham. I have a handmade wooden carving by my grandfather of the cricketer. I got him to autograph this book.\nShep by David Shepherd - My grandfather was a teacher with the cricket umpire David Shepherd for a while at Ilfracombe school. He also watched me play once at Instow where he lived.\nMy Life by Earvin Magic Johnson - Another one of my sporting heroes. I supported the Lakers since 1984 - the Showtime era. I also got to see him play in an \"friendly\" basketball match in London after he retired. \nSchindler's Ark by Thomas Keneally - I had to study this book for A Level English, before the film came out. It was the only book on that course that I actually enjoyed reading - and one of the few where the book and the film are both exceptional.\nAdventureman and Running America by Jamie McDonald - Jamie McDonald is a legend who comes from Gloucester. He puts himself through incredible tests to raise money for children's charities - running across Canada and later America are two examples. A real life hero.\nMisc\nThe Language of Mathematics by Frank Land - This book belonged to my grandfather and he gave it to me.\nHow Buildings Learn by Stewart Brand - I really liked how relevant this is to software development as well in the way that something that has been built changes over time and also needs maintenance.\nWhat Do You Care What Other People Think? and Surely You're Joking Mr Feynman by Richard Feynman - Both of these books are collections of different stories about the Nobel prize winning physicist. A few are serious however most are incredible and fun stories about his life.\nThe Deeper Meaning of Liff by Douglas Adams and John Lloyd - Think of an odd place name and now create a definition of what it might mean. This book consists of hundreds of place names and their made up definitions. I once even visited a village called Wetwang because of this book.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/favouritebooks/","title":"Favourite books"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/fearofjudgement/":{"body":"In the Alchemist by Paulo Coelho there is a quote “There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.” This ties in nicely with an observation from Gino Wickman in a podcast with Lewis Howes (School of Greatness) recently. He observed that in a lot of cases the fear of failure is really a fear of judgement.\n\nBased on these two observations you could surmise that maybe one of the things that makes a dream impossible is a fear of judgement. Is the fear of what others may think preventing progress towards that dream?\nPersonally when I was growing up, especially at school, I was driven by a fear of failure. I was scared to make mistakes. I would not question things in class and I would work very hard to ensure I knew as much as possible so there was less risk of being wrong.\nI would not talk to people I didn’t know and I would not take many risks. Some of these things are still part of who I am today. \nTaking this in context with the above, a lot of my fear of failure was driven by what others would think of me - I was always conscious of how they might react to what I did. Would they make fun of me? Would they have a different opinion of me?\nMy teenage daughter recently had the opportunity to preach for ten minutes on the subject of fear at our church. I am not going to discuss the fear of public speaking however I am going to highlight one phrase that came out of her message. She was talking about the section in the bible where Jesus’ disciples are in the boat and a storm suddenly rages - Jesus is asleep. They wake him.and he calms the storm. He then asks them “Why are you so afraid?” (Mark 4:40).\nIt is a great question to ask next time you are scared to do something - whether you are a Christian or not. Why am I so afraid to do … (insert the action of your choice)? Is it because you really are afraid or is it because you are really afraid of what others may think? \nNext time you are confronted with a task that you are afraid of could it be the fear of failure and in turn the fear of being judged by others that is holding you back?

The second involves telling one or more friends who you care about that you are going to do something by a certain time.

Unfortunately once it started the builders found out that the previous owners had done a poor job with the foundations at the back of the house and these needed to be re-dug. The good news is they found the issue before building on the poor foundations. The bad news is that this unplanned work delayed the work for over three months and led to a lot of pain.\nIf the foundations had been correct in the first place then this could have been avoided.\nIn the book Crazy Faith by Michael Todd, he states:\n\nThe integrity of the foundation you build your life on determines the type of structure that can be built on it.\n\nThis is true in building, in life and in work. It is worth investing time in getting the foundations right before you build or grow.\n\nWe spent a lot of time in the team I work with building the foundations of the culture and the way we work. It was a conscious decision and it took effort to build it. Sometimes there was pressure from other areas in the business to change but, where it was important, we resisted that pressure. This has proved to be the right decision and the team has flourished.\nOur church is relatively new - about two and a half years old.

We used to do this all in a room with post-it notes - a fairly traditional approach. We would set up 4 areas: Liked, Longed, Learned and Lacked and proceed to plaster post-it notes over the different sections. Once everyone had finished we would organise each section into themes and then discuss and agree actions.\n\nGoing fully remote has obviously meant we need to take a different approach and we now drive it from a shared document we create for each retrospective in Google Docs. Whilst working with the document we are all on a video call to discuss things as they occur.\nThe first part of the document is a recap of any  previous actions - this adds a level of accountability. We discuss each previous action to ensure either someone has done it, it is no longer needed or it is added as a new action. Every previous action should fall into one of these three buckets.\nFor the main part of the retrospective we initially tried using the same four areas but found that sometimes the same comments came up in different sections or it was difficult to determine where a comment should go. To address this we culled this down to just two areas: Liked and Lacked (or To Improve) - i.e. what has gone well and what do we need to work on?\nWe set a timer for 10 minutes and everyone adds bullet points in both sections. A small tip - add a page of bullet points first to each section and encourage people to add in different spots on that list otherwise you get lots of confusion as people try to add in the same place. We also encourage fun comments, which may or may not be directly relevant, as this lightens up the later discussions and helps set the culture of the team.\nAfter about 10 minutes - it doesn't have to be exact - we check if anyone is still adding points. If they are we ask them to let everyone know when they are done.\nOnce everyone has finished we get one person to read through all the \"liked\" bullet points. These very rarely lead to discussions but are important to celebrate what is going well. Regularly it will highlight the result of a change from a previous retrospective.\nSomeone else will read through the \"lacked\" list next. If any points need clarification this is the time to raise those questions to ensure everyone understands what each one means.\nIf there appear to be themes, or the list is long, we reorganise it into group to make the next stage simpler. Often the same point will be raised in different ways and this means they can be merged together.\nEach team member is allocated three votes. Over the next couple of minutes they add their votes to the points that they think are most important and need to be discussed. They must use all three - if they only see one or two things they want to discuss they can add multiple votes to a single item (although this rarely seems to happen).\nOnce this is complete we order them by the highest number of votes. If there is a draw in the number of votes then either ask the team to order them. \nWe take the highest voted item and discuss it for up to 10 minutes. If at the end of that time the discussion is still on-going we ask the team if we want to carry on with this item. If so, we ask the same question every 5-10 minutes. \nOnce that item is complete, we pick up the next item and keep repeating until we run out of time.\nAs actions are generated we capture them at the end of the document. Every action should have a person against it - this is key otherwise actions don't happen as no-one takes responsibility. Occasionally we have items that apply to the whole team and we will mark the action with \"team\" rather than just leaving it blank as it seems to add a level of accountability and they are all answerable to each other. Ideally we still have one person own it to ensure the action gets handled.\nAn example document, including votes in the \"lacked\" section:\n\nWhen we started it would take up about 90 minutes and the \"lacked\" list was much longer than the \"liked\" list. Over time we have got this down to about an hour and the size of the lists has been reversed. \nI have used retrospectives a number of times in the past however this approach has proven to be very focussed, very productive and probably the most successful I have encountered.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/fullyremoteretrospectives/","title":"How to easily implement successful remote team retrospectives"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/futuredevelopers/":{"body":"The role of the software developer is set for a major upheaval over the coming years.\n\nIn the past I have thought of programming and software development as a career path that should be \"safe\" in the future. There have been many waves of tools that have claimed to be able to develop applications either with no coding or very little coding. These have, on the whole, failed to take off. However this is all now changing.\nA lot has been written about the impact AI will have on jobs, including software development. There are new tools appearing every day to assist in the development of software and this is starting to have an impact on the speed it can be developed. \nMaybe AI will follow a similar path to the one that opened up when spreadsheets became mainstream and allow those with little or no programming expertise to experiment and do things they had no hope of doing before?\n\nThese tools are changing the way programmers work. That is not the only way they are having an impact.\nIn an article by Rockford Lhotka he highlights the career path from programmer to developer and his concerns that the first step will be eroded by the use of AI.

I was chatting to a friend recently and she mentioned that her son, who is studying Computer Science, has struggled to get any form of work experience. She has reached out to people she knows who previously may have offered him the opportunity but are no longer able to as they work from home. \nI think the role of the programmer/developer is at the start of a very big change. These new tools could massively increase their productivity - both in writing and understanding code. For certain types of development they could even potentially replace them or at a minimum change existing roles dramatically.

However they realized this was down to a different generational mindset.\n\nThis was highlighted when I was walking behind two teenagers recently and they just took random arbitrary pictures of themselves as they were walking.\nThey view photos as disposable. There is basically no overhead to taking hundreds of images - it is just point at something (ideally including themselves) and click the button as many times as they like. They also have huge numbers of  filters that can then be applied to tweak it in various ways.\nThose of us brought up in the age where photos were taken on film have a different mindset. When we took photos there was a cost involved - it cost money to develop the photos and also there were limited photos available to take on each film. We had to spend time thinking about the photo we were about to take before pressing the button.\nIt appears that this mindset has continued for a lot of people into the modern digital era. Despite the low overhead, we still take the time to compose the shot before taking it.

Something is new and exciting but before too long it becomes the normal and we are no longer excited by it. It seems to be part of our nature.\n\nHe refers to a section in a book by Tom Holkenborg where he talks about how to “continuously build on that anticipation of what comes next,” \n\nEvery time the DJ drops a new track, it feels louder than anything else that you’ve heard before, which is actually not the case! What happens is you drop a new track, and then over the course of three to five minutes, you make it ever so slightly quieter. And then the new track comes in and it’s back at the level where the original one started, and then everything feels so loud.\n\nIt would be interesting to try this as a way to maintain excitement - dial down the use or interaction with something over time and then use it again after a while. Will we get a level of excitement back again? \nCould this observation be used in education in some way to maintain focus and interest? Maybe the structure of the lesson could be changed so that it effectively gets gradually \"quieter\" and then louder when the next piece of information/learning is introduced. A lesson then becomes a cycle of new information that continuously engages the learner.\nHe also mentions \"We tend to think a lot about what we do, but we rarely think about the order in which we do it.\". This is a really interesting observation and he calls out self-education as one area that can be impacted by this. This could also potentially be applied to the approach above - could changing the order of learning or the type of presentation of learning change the overall result?\nSoftware development went through a phase where the focus was writing the tests before the code which for some people made a huge difference. Agile development also shook up the order things were done - not waiting for the full design and architecture to be complete before starting the development.\nWhat other areas could be impacted if the order of doing things was changed? \nLinks\nDJing on the hedonic treadmill\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/gettingquieter/","title":"Getting quieter to get louder"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/githubssh/":{"body":"Just a reminder of the starting point for setting up SSH with Github so I don't have to keep looking for it each time.\n\nLinks\nConnecting to GitHub with SSH\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/githubssh/","title":"Setting up Github SSH"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/givingsecondchances/":{"body":"Sometimes people need a second chance.\n\nIn the Simon Sinek interview with Leland Melvin they talk about giving a second chance to an employee and how they can sometimes turn out to be the best employee.\n\nAre you good at giving other people a second shot? Sometimes the disenfranchised that don't get the first shot because of whatever situation that people see them in. And that's probably one of your best employees that they get a shot. You think about second chances. Instead of a firing an employee, you give them the second shot and they're your star because they didn't get fired for doing this thing or whatever happened. They're your best employee.\n\nI have encountered this a number of times in my career.\nWhen I used to run the engineering team for a consultancy a young engineer did something stupid - a prank that he shouldn't have done. We had to decide whether to fire him or give him a second chance. It was not an easy decision and we spent a number of days discussing it and going back and forth. In the end we decided to give him another chance and he would hopefully learn from it. He definitely learnt from it and went on to become one of our best engineers.\nLater in my career I was leading a team of developers at a bank. One of the engineers was really struggling and there were discussions about letting him go (I was not the decision maker). They decided to give him a chance to prove himself. I reviewed every change he made and made suggestions on how they could be improved.\nA lot of people would take this the wrong way and see it as constant criticism. To this person's credit (and he should take all the credit) he used it to learn and took everything on board. Slowly over time his code improved and he required less and less guidance. I left the project after about eighteen months and he is still there today - over a decade later.\nI was also given a second chance. When I started out as a consultant I was working for a customer and I didn't get on with the project manager. It was purely down to a difference in cultures. I went to my boss and said I couldn't continue to work there (I was young and naïve at the time). He knew the project manager and was surprised at my issues. The boss of the company I was working at told my boss that I should be fired but he persuaded her to give me another chance.\nI went back to work there and in the end I got on really well with the project manager, once I understood the differences, and he was actually a really nice guy. I stayed with the consultancy for a couple of years and then my boss and I went off and started our own consultancy - which would never of happened if I had not been given a second chance.\nSometimes something someone does, or does not do, means a second chance is not possible however look for opportunities for people to have that second chance. We do, hopefully, learn from our mistakes.\nLinks\nExploration with Leland Melvin - Simon Sinek/\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/givingsecondchances/","title":"Giving second chances"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/gmailsyncissueonandroid/":{"body":"I occasionally stop getting Gmail notifications on my Google Pixel 2XL android phone.

This was based on a podcast with Will Guidara where he talked through how he got his restaurant, Eleven Madison Park, to be voted the number one restaurant in the world by focussing not just on the food but the overall experience.\nIt started when he overheard some guests say the one regret of their food visit to New York was not experiencing a \"dirty water hot dog\". He ran out, bought a hot dog from a street vendor and persuaded his chef to serve it to the guests, explaining he didn't want them to leave New York with any food regrets.\nThe reaction he got was the most amazing he had ever seen about food and it only cost him $2. It came from him listening and then acting to make their experience memorable.\nHe learnt from this and encouraged his team to look for these opportunities. However the servers also had their normal role to perform so they added a new staff member whose sole role was to help them create these experiences:\n\nWe decided that it was important enough to invest resources to make it happen more frequently. And so we added a position to the restaurant. Someone whose only job was to help bring other people's ideas to life. So we called the position the dream weaver. I wanted people who are helping to weave dreams for people, to give people memories. People don't collect stuff anymore. They collect experiences and I wanted to create a position that could help us give people memories that would last a lifetime because if you don't have those, then is the experience even worth collecting. I think this is where leaders fall short.\n\nIn this video he gives examples of some of the experiences they have created. A couple came in to console themselves after their beach vacation was cancelled. The restaurant turned the dining area into their own beach with sand, folding chairs and a kids pool of water they could dip their feet into. For a family of four from Spain, the kids saw snow through the window for the first time, so the restaurant hired a chauffeur driven SUV, drove them to Central Park so they could play in the fresh snow.\nThe side effect of this was that not only were the guests happier but the team were as well. They had a chance to create and execute their own ideas.\nThe key is not treating people as a commodity but as a unique individual - look for opportunities to connect, make things special and memorable. And remember it can something small - it started with a $2 hot dog.\nLinks\nUnreasonable Hospitality \nThe Secret Ingredients of Great Hospitality | Will Guidara | TED - YouTube\nUnreasonable Hospitality with Will Guidara podcast\nAs an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/goingaboveandbeyond/","title":"Going above and beyond"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/goodholiday/":{"body":"We are not a family that likes to just sit on the beach. We may spend a little time doing that - everyone needs to relax - but we tend to prefer doing and seeing things.\n\nWhen we go on holiday is it better to go somewhere new or visit somewhere we have previously visited and liked? Some people like to go back to the same place over and over again but we have a preference to visit new places. There are some exceptions to this.\nEvery year or two we try to visit Australia as my in-laws live in Sydney. We have also taken the kids to Florida a couple of times. Outside that we tend to favour new experiences and new places.\nWe were on holiday in Newquay a couple of years ago. I woke up thinking about what makes some holidays stand out more than others. Up until that point the holiday had been okay but not great - partly as we were all recovering from colds.\nI determined that it comes down to three things: people, places and actions. If you have an extreme of one of these then it creates a reaction and in turn a memory. So, if you have great people then you remember it because of them - alternatively the same can happen if there are dreadful people. If somewhere you go stands out for some reason then it will also be memorable - good or bad; and the same with something you do or if something happens.\nTaking a step back, it could be rephrased as \"who\", \"where\" and \"what\". This can then be extended to include two more aspects: \"when\" and \"why\". It could stand out due to when it happens - an unusual time of the day or year or maybe a special occasion. There could also be a \"why\" that is important - the reason for doing the holiday or activity.\nWhen you look through these lenses you can see why some holidays stand out more than others - they tended to be at one end of one or more of these axes. A walking holiday in Bulgaria was memorable for me because of the other people I met on the trip. The trip to the west coast of America was memorable because of the places I saw and the activities I did. The trip to Newquay I mentioned at the beginning became memorable when we did more new things and visited places we hadn't been to before on a previous trip to Cornwall.\nThis can also be applied to life - look for ways to push the boundaries on these axes to create those memories.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/goodholiday/","title":"What makes a good holiday?"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/goodstrategy/":{"body":"I've had this book a while but never got around to reading it properly. One of my colleagues at work was listening to the audio version of it and recommended it. This was an excellent read and very relevant to what is happening at the company I am working at at the moment. For me the key takeaway was that what most people call strategy is not actually strategy but vision or goals. Strategy is setting a direction and what needs to happen to achieve it. The observations about the approaches of Walmart and Cisco were particularly good.\n\nMy key highlights:\n\nGood strategy works by focusing energy and resources on one, or a very few, pivotal objectives whose accomplishment will lead to a cascade of favorable outcomes.\n\n\nThe core content of a strategy is a diagnosis of the situation at hand, the creation or identification of a guiding policy for dealing with the critical difficulties, and a set of coherent actions.\n\n\nA great deal of strategy work is trying to figure out what is going on. Not just deciding what to do, but the more fundamental problem of comprehending the situation.\n\n\nGood strategy is not just “what” you are trying to do. It is also “why” and “how” you are doing it.\n\n\nThe most critical anticipations are about the behavior of others, especially rivals.\n\n\nWhat one single feasible objective, when accomplished, would make the biggest difference?\n\n\nWhen a product gives a buyer an advantage in competition with others, there will be an especially rapid uptake of the product.\n\n\nIn my own case, I rely on outside help—I invoke a virtual panel of experts that I carry around in my mind. This panel of experts is a collection of people whose judgments I value. I use an internal mental dialogue with them to both critique my own ideas and stimulate new ones.\n\n\nTo commit to a judgment is to choose an interpretation of which issues are critical and which are not and then to choose an implied action. By committing to a judgment—especially a diagnosis—you increase the probability that you will disagree with some of the assessments of others, and thereby increase the chance of learning something. The same principle applies to any meeting you attend. What issues do you expect to arise in the meeting? Who will take which position? Privately commit yourself in advance to some judgments about these issues, and you will have daily opportunities to learn, improve, and re-calibrate your judgment.\n\nLinks\nGood Strategy/Bad Strategy\nAs an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/goodstrategy/","title":"Good Strategy/Bad Strategy by Richard P.

We're all part of multiple tribes. All of those tribes, large and small, they have a set of expectations. They have a set of social norms. They have a set of beliefs that, this is how you act in this group. This is what's normal and expected. And the more that your habits align with the expectations of the group, the easier it is to stick with them, the more appealing and attractive they are because they signal to the people around you, hey look, I'm part of this. And the more that they go against the grain of the tribes that you belong to, the harder they are to stick to.\n\nWe can use those around us and our environment to help enforce habits.

There are ways to reduce the reliance on luck as some ideas will just never work - or at least have a much smaller chance of success.\nThe favourite approach is to produce an MVP (minimum viable product) and experiment with that to identify if anyone would buy it and if so what features do they really need. This still implies spending time on implementing the idea, possibly developing code or a prototype.\nAn article by Kendall Miller proposes a set of questions to consider before even going as far as working on the MVP. Depending on the idea, it could potentially save a lot of work. He proposes three criteria for identifying \"ideas that win\":\n\nWhat unmet need of an existing market are we satisfying? It is easier going after an existing market than creating a new one.\nWho will pay for this system, and what are they used to paying? Identify who will pay and how much.\nWhy are we uniquely positioned to succeed? They need a reason to pick you over others.\n\nIt is very easy to just focus on one or two of these criteria.\n\nHowever it is important to address all three to have a chance of success. If there is no unmet need then why should they use your product and buy from you? If they won't pay then you have no sales? If you can't differentiate from other offerings then why should they buy from you as opposed to someone else?\nAssuming you are developing a software product, he says:\n\nA rough rule of thumb when creating a new product is that 20% of your cost will be in the engineering of the product itself.

The key difference though is that you publish them in a random order.\nIt may sound counterintuitive to publish this all for free if you plan to make money from it. The monetizable value comes from the next steps of organisation and application.\nProducing a form of this information that is organised in some way adds additional value to the consumer. It can take the form of possibly producing some form of media, whether it is a course, a book or something else, The organisation of this random information, that they may already have, brings significant value that they are often willing to pay for. It reduces the effort they have to put in to organize it themselves and consume/learn from the information.\nYou can take this to another level by focusing on application - how can they apply this information to their world and make use of it. This can take the form of consulting or it can be in the form of another form of media. Again, this is removing effort for them in that it shows them how to apply it without them having to work it out themselves. The clearer this step is in how they can use this information, the more value it has.\nIn an interview between Nathan Barry and Katelyn Bourgoin she explains that she has multiple levels of product that she sells. The one thing that brings the highest value return to customers and causes them to pick a more expensive option is the inclusion of a checklist showing how everything else can be put into practice.\nThe key takeaway for me is that people should not be afraid of giving away their knowledge and ideas and yet there is still a way to benefit from this and provide benefits to the end consumer.\nLinks\nHow to overcome the fear of selling.

Given my son’s love of the Xbox I have also wondered if it could be used in some way to help him study.\n\nThe David Perell podcast with Daniel Gross discussed gamification and made an interesting observation about viewing life as a series of games. When you set out to achieve a goal for example there is the opportunity to gamify it. However the observation that stuck out for me was that if something makes you feel like you want to quit it is like the level is too hard.\nSo, if you are trying to learn something and you hit a point where you want to quit it could be that you are trying something too difficult at this point - the level is too hard - and you should try something, anything, that is simpler and gives you a sense of achievement. The tricky part is finding that level where you are challenging yourself but not to the point where it is too difficult and making you want to stop.\nLinks\nDaniel Gross: Dreams and Determination\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/istheleveltoohard/","title":"Is the level too hard?"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/istria/":{"body":"We recently spent just under two weeks visiting Croatia and in particular the Istrian peninsular. These are my notes and thoughts from the holiday.\nAccomodation\nHotel Parentium\nWe stayed for 11 nights at the Hotel Parentium which sits on a peninsula between Plava Laguna and Zelena Laguna to the south of Poreč. We had two Classic rooms. The rooms were relatively spacious, well equipped and clean. They have a balcony, although the view is of an astro turf covered roof and other rooms with balconies. It didn't bother us as we didn't spend a lot of time in the room. Wi-Fi was very usable throughout the hotel although it is an open network so you might want to consider using a VPN.\n\nThe hotel itself is lovely. It is really really clean and well maintained. It has a wellbeing centre with a gym, indoor pool and spa facilities. The gym is well equipped and was never too busy. The indoor pool was lovely and warm and also never over full. The two outside pools were nice although a little on the cold side when we were there. Being able to order a drink while in the pool was a nice touch. Sunbeds are around the pool as well as in the grounds and by the sea. Towels can be picked up by the pool. The sunbeds were busy especially by mid afternoon but it was usually possible to find one or two.\n\nThe hotel also has a sort of beach which is effectively a concrete promenade you can walk on with areas that provide access to the sea. Despite this description, they were actually quite nice and we used this quite a lot. The sea was relatively warm. I would recommend using pool shoes and the steps in and some of the rocks can be a little slippery. There are also areas with trees including hammocks that can be freely used. The view of the sunset was excellent from here.\n\nThere are a couple of restaurants next to the hotel as well as a small shop which was useful for snacks and drinks. It has a limited supply but is convenient. On the other side of the hotel you can walk towards all the other hotels and restaurants for Zelena Laguna. This is the busier and more touristy side. There are beach volleyball courts here and also some following the footpath towards Poreč . There are a few table tennis tables next to the restaurant by the hotel (not sure if these are paid for or not).\nWe stayed half board (we got a good deal) and I would recommend doing this if you can. The breakfast buffet is good with a lot of variety. The same can be said for the evening buffet. On the whole the quality and variety were very good and they did vary it a bit each day. Some of the food is cooked at the buffet. In the morning there is plenty of juice - if you want coffee or hot water for tea just ask one of the waiters if they don't approach you immediately. In the evening you will need to pay for drinks - these are a little on the pricey side. It is convenient to be able to easily sign things to the room.\nMost evenings there is also some form of musical entertainment. This ranges from piano music in the reception area to duets or small bands either there or outside. All were of a pretty decent quality and we regularly grabbed a drink and listened to them in the evening. We took cards and Uno with us and played them with the kids while listening - a very good move bringing the games.\n\nParking is charged at 1 euro per day and they have a car park behind a barrier. This is always busy and can be difficult to find a space sometimes. If you have the card on the dashboard you can park on the hill up to the hotel, as long as it is not directly Infront of the hotel - maybe worth checking with them if you are unsure.\nThe main nationality of guests seems to be Germans with a smattering of various other nationalities including a few British. The staff all spoke good English and were very helpful. A nice touch was a bottle of wine and a card in the room on my wife's birthday - we hadn't told them. \nThe cleaners are good although they sometimes have a tendency to knock and enter without much warning in the morning so do use the \"do not disturb\" door hanger when needed. Air conditioning worked well and all the lights are controlled from a few consoles around the room. There are electric plugs next to the bed (annoyingly not all hotels do this). There is a safe, a mini bar and a TV in each room and lots of storage space.\nWe really enjoyed our stay and would recommend it, especially for families.\nRestaurants\nCiao Ciao, Poreč\nWe ate at Ciao Ciao twice. The first time was at lunchtime as my son and I wandered through the town and wanted somewhere to eat. We got a table immediately and ordered pizzas. The service was friendly, fast and they spoke good English. \nThe second time we visited we had finished a boat trip in the evening and everywhere was much busier. We decided to go back as it was good the first time. It was much fuller but they still found us a table and again the food and service, despite the number of people, was excellent. We sat in a terrace area upstairs - if you have the choice it is a little nicer up there.\nA special mention should go to the waiters there as they work really hard (probably a little understaffed, especially in the evening) but are still efficient and helpful.\nRestaurant Korta, Zelena Laguna\nThis restaurant was convenient for where we were staying and looked like one of the slightly nicer restaurants in the area that also had a menu that the kids could pick from. Between us we had salmon, spaghetti bolognese, wiener schnitzel and a pizza. All were really nice and reasonably priced. The restaurant was pleasant with plenty of outdoor seating and the waiter who served us was very friendly, helpful and spoke good English.\nVilla Romana, Zelena Laguna\nWe got takeaway pizzas from here one evening so we could take them and watch the sunset nearby. They were ordered and cooked in less than 15 minutes. Nice pizzas and reasonably priced. It made for a fun, memorable evening.\n\nAttractions/Things to do\nMonvi Tours\nWe booked two tours with Monvi Tours - the sunset dolphin cruise and the all day cruise (\"fish picnic\"). They sail from Poreč  but do two additional pickups - one of which is Zelena Laguna (by Villa Romana) which was very convenient for where we were staying. \nThe boat can accommodate 180 people and has four toilets - which were clean. There is a mixture of seating upstairs - some wooden benches and some plastic chairs. Downstairs it is padded benches. The crew are excellent and very helpful - one in particular clearly loves his job. \n\nWe were told when we booked there was \"live piano music\". This is not quite true as it is actually the boss of the company playing very cheesy songs on a synthesizer which he sings along to. For us, it added to the atmosphere and became a running joke but I could imagine for some people it might be a little annoying. 'Rolling on the river' seems to be a particular \"highlight\" of his repertoire.\nSunset Dolphin Tour\nWe picked up this tour from Poreč as it can get busy and we wanted to get a decent seat. It cost 35 Euros per person. It lasts for about three hours with drinks included - if you like blueberry squash or some low end white wine. You can also purchase other drinks from a bar.\nWe saw plenty of dolphins on our trip and the sunset was nice. There are lots of other boats out so it does feel a little like once one boat sees one then all the others come rushing over but they did seem to keep their distance from them.\n\nVrsar, Lim Fjord, Rovinj\nWe picked up the boat from Zelena Laguna. The cost was 50 Euros each. It was relatively full so we ended up with a table downstairs as all the space upstairs was taken. We still had a good view and the focus on this trip is the places visited.\nThe first stop was Vrsar. We were told when we booked that this was a place where there was a beach and you could swim. However on turning up there was just the usual busy pebble beach which was very busy - so not worth taking swimming stuff. However there is an old town but you only get an hour here so it would be a push to see it properly - you should head off straightaway once docked.\nThe next sight was Lim Fjord. This is where they also serve the food. Yes, it's nice but probably not worth a visit just to see it - good to have as part of the trip.\nThe food was actually really good for a boat trip. There is a choice of fish (a large fish), meat (sausage and chicken) or a vegetarian wrap. All are served with salad and bread. You pick your option when you get on. There is also free low end white wine and squash for this part of the trip. You can buy other drinks at any time during the day. There are a lot of seagulls on this bit that track the boat knowing there might be food.\n\nThe last stop was Rovinj and for us this was the highlight. It is a really nice old town and you get about 2 hours here. We walked up to the top of the hill through narrow streets to take in the view by the church. We then descended and spent time in the market. After that it was the trip back to be dropped off.\n\nDuring the whole trip there is a commentary at various points in multiple languages (4 or 5). Personally I didn't gain much from the commentary and it does go on a bit once they get through all the languages but you can easily ignore it.\nOverall we really enjoyed our day.\nAquacolors Water Park\nWe spent a day at the Aquacolors water park. We arrived about half an hour after it opened. It was already pretty busy but the queue wasn't too bad. We paid for a locker and two sets of sunbeds. Once in the park we took sunbeds at the far end as most had been taken nearer the entrance. We ended up not using the locker and there seemed to be a lot of people who were using sunbeds that hadn't paid for them (no reservation bands on the poles) - I am not sure what they do to solve this. So if you visit you might want to think twice about paying for the sunbeds and a locker.\nOne tip - at the end of the day our bag was raided by a seagull so if you might want to hang it up on the hooks at the top of the umbrellas to prevent this - we didn't do this until too late.\nA lot of people mention the queues for the rides. There were some but they were manageable and they did seem to move. Sometimes it was tricky to get an inflatable so that involved waiting until one came free. The kids enjoyed the rides (especially Turbolance and Black Hole). My wife and I mainly spent time in the lazy river and wave pool. The lazy river was very relaxing, once you got an inflatable, and it sometimes has waves to add interest.\nWe did try the fast food outlet nearby. We just had some chicken nuggets and chips, which were okay, however it was incredibly slow service - definitely not \"fast\" food. They say you can't take food or drink in but we were not searched.\nThe bands to pay for things seem to work well and you just need to go to the cashier outlet at the end to pay. A fun, although slightly expensive, day out for the family.\nBaredine Caves\nWe visited the Baredine Caves during a wet period of weather. This meant it was busier than usual. We queued up for about 20-30 minutes and bought our tickets but the earliest slot for an English speaking tour was about 2.5 hours later. Luckily we were staying close enough to go back there and come back later. For those unable to do this there are a couple of small exhibitions and a cafe but not a lot else.\nAs for the tour itself, when your time comes you enter a covered area and meet your guide. They give you a quick introduction as well as a warning that it is 270 steps to the bottom and then the same number back up. We took jumpers as we had read it could be cool in the cave but didn't really need them.\nYou descend into the cave and at various points the guide will point out the sights. There is only one way in and out so it also provides a point where other groups can pass you in the opposite direction. The caves themselves are quite impressive and there is quite a lot to see in the forty minutes. At the bottom there are a couple of albino amphibians to see that live water at the bottom of the cave you see on the tour. On the way out you walk up all the steps in one go.\n\nThe tour was good and well worth seeing.\nTowns\nPoreč\nIf you are staying at Plava Laguna or Zelena Laguna there are few ways to get to Poreč. The easiest is probably the tourist train. It runs about every 35 minutes and takes about 25 minutes to wind its way along the cost. Cost is 4 euros per person each way. We used this a number of times and it was fun and convenient. However it does get busy so get there early if you can. Also if you intend to pick it up at one of the stops on the way then there is a good chance it will be full. If you miss the train then a taxi from Poreč to Zelena Laguna is 15 euros.\n\nWe also walked to Poreč  and back from Zelena Laguna. It took just over an hour each way. If you do this it follows the coast most of the way but it is worth cutting the corner and going through the Apartments Bellevue Plaza resort - there some steps up to the pool area and then down the other side. Despite being a good hill, it saves a good chunk of time.\nAs for Poreč, it is a nice town. The train arrives near the marina and you can walk from there to the old town - which is the main focus. You pass through a small market that sells mostly standard tourist stuff.\nThe old town is nice and you can walk along the front past all the boats and the tourist tour stands. Unlike a lot of places we didn't get a lot of hard selling and hassle which made a nice change. \nThere is one main shopping street, Decomanus Street, and this is the main focus. There are lots of small streets branching out from this. It has a wide range of shops and restaurants. It also has a much more lively and completely different busy feel at night.\nThe main attraction is the Basilica however we didn't visit this. There is a very good ice cream shop next to it though - Il gelato di Salvatore.\nOn a different note, we did need a pharmacy while we were visiting and the Pharmacy Salus on Ul. Mate Vlašića was good and they spoke good English.\nPula\nWe did a day trip to Pula. The drive from Poreč to Pula was about 45 minutes using the toll road. It was about 4 euros. On the way back we took the scenic route along the coast which was a nice drive.\nParking in Pula can be tricky and expensive however if you don't mind a short walk, we parked at Parking Mandrač. All day parking was about 6 euros and you pay for it by scanning a QR code on the sign and following the instructions. You can then walk back towards Pula. The parking closer to the town was very busy and lots of people seemed to be having issues with the machines.\nThe main attraction in Pula is the roman arena. It is well worth a visit although it only took us an hour to see all of it. The queue was short and once inside you can wander around. There are toilets on the right hand side, half way around. It is pretty impressive although the historic nature of it is spoilt a little by the modern stage they had erected in the middle when we visited. The structure itself is impressive and you can sit on the steps/seats to appreciate it. There is also a small exhibition in the tunnels under the arena which is worth a look.\n\nFrom there we went on to Zerostrasse. This is a series of tunnels that were built originally as shelters for the war. They are well preserved and they stretch quite a distance. It was nice to visit but we didn't find them that exciting. It also gives you access to the fortress above and this was, for us, more interesting. You can wander all the way around the walls and there is a tower you can climb that gives great views of the city. There can be a little bit of a queue to go back down the single elevator.\n\nPula was okay to visit but lacked a little bit of atmosphere compared to Poreč .\nRabac\nThe town of Rabac is just over an hour from Poreč via the toll road and then some quite windy roads. It is quite a picturesque drive through some hilly country including a nice hairpin bend. \nIn terms of parking, we parked on the hill near \"Park Hill Residences\" which was free and also had some cover under trees. There is a bit of a hill straight down to the beach front. We turned left and continued to the headland which is Lanterna beach.\n\nYou can hire sun beds, a little bit pricey - 25 euros for 2 beds and an umbrella - however it does give some shade and is a great spot. There are toilets, changing facilities, showers and a small cafe (excellent toasted ciabatta). The water is crystal clear and there are steps to easily enter and swim. We also saw lots of fish swimming in the shallows where we were standing and paddling.\nA very nice day out and we would certainly visit there again.\nMiscellaneous\nDriving\nWe hired a car through Sixt. Picking up the car was a little slow as there was no-one initially in the office but after that it was fine.\nWe were given a Peugeot 5008 which wasn't a bad car. It was handy that the cockpit display showed the current speed limit as we drove as the Croatians seem to pick speed limits randomly and change them every few seconds. I didn't work out the logic for their system so assumed it was based on someone picking a random number, walking a random distance and then picking another one. We relied very heavily on the display to guide us. There are a few speed cameras around, usually with a sign just before them, so be aware.\nWe managed to get Android Auto working so we could use Google Maps rather than the built in navigation - bring a spare USB cable with you in case.\nRoads are generally good as long as you don't go too off the beaten track. The toll roads are very good and pretty reasonably priced. You pick up a ticket on entry and there are manned payment barriers when you exit.\nThere are very few traffic lights so they seem to rely on roundabouts. Indicating on a roundabout seems to be a rarity except by foreign drivers.\nPula Airport\nI visited Pula airport when it was still part of Yugoslavia. In those days it was mostly a military base with a terminal that mostly consisted of a canvas roof and bunch of cheap plastic garden furniture. In comparison to that, it has advanced substantially however compared to most other international airports it still has quite a way to go.\nThere is a cafe and a duty free shop but that is about it. There are tables and chairs. Luckily there are not many flights and when a flight is called half the people will disappear and seats will become available. We didn't manage to locate a water fountain.\nBe aware that you will need to pass through passport control once your gate is called so allow some time - not that it is that busy.\nGatwick Airport Parking\nWe parked our car at the APH car park at Gatwick. I have used Purple Parking in the past but was very impressed with APH. The buses seemed to be more frequent and the drivers were noticeably more friendly and helpful.\nWe had an issue with opening the car when we got back and they came and helped - again couldn't do enough to help and helped us quickly resolve the problem (key fob battery was getting flat).\nLinks\nHotel Parentium \nCiao Ciao\nRestaurant Korta \nVilla Romana \nMonvi Tours \nAquacolors \nBaredine Caves \nPoreč Tourist Train \nPula Arena \nZerostrasse\nLanterna Beach \nSixt\nPula Airport\nAPH\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/istria/","title":"Istrian holiday notes and tips"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/jasgoals/":{"body":"About fifteen years ago, Casey Treat spoke at our church about goal setting. He explained that a lot of people set a goal of reaching a certain weight and he said the problem with that occurs when you reach that weight.\n\nHe explained that when you reach that weight the only way to reach the goal again is for your weight to change and this is often what happens and it becomes a cycle. \nHe suggested that any goal set should be less about specifics and more about long term. Using the weight example, he proposed that the goal should be to reach and stay at a healthy weight. This is both achievable and sustainable.\nSimilarly, having a goal to run a marathon is a one off goal. Having a goal to run a certain amount at a certain frequency is again both achievable and sustainable.\nThis sounds very similar to something called the \"arrival fallacy\". This is the mistaken believe that “When I achieve this goal, then I will be happy.”. There is an element of truth to it in that you will be happy for a short time but numerous studies show that this will only be short lived. There is a lot more detail on this in an article by Ness Labs (see links below).\nThey also highlight that over estimation of our resulting happiness can have an impact on our decision making:\n\nThe impact bias leads to an overestimation of the duration and intensity of the positive emotions you may feel as a result of an event. We overestimate the positive impact the accomplishment of a goal will have, and we underestimate how other events or feelings may influence the way we feel.\n\nThe article suggests that we should change the focus on the process of achieving the goal as much as the result. This includes:\n\nAvoid tying happiness just to reaching the goal\nFocus on experiencing joy at each step on the journey\nCelebrate the small wins\n\nSo from this, maybe the way forward is that we should focus on JAS goals - the enjoy the journey to the goal and make sure the goal is achievable and sustainable.\nLinks\nThe arrival fallacy\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/jasgoals/","title":"JAS goals"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/just/":{"body":"It is very easy to make assumptions about a subject you know well and others may not.

This was not luck as the house had been designed and built to withstand the forces that were thrown it. This includes pilings that were driven 40 feet into the ground as well as key design decisions made to minimize the risk of damage.\nHe posed the question \"What has the storm revealed about your foundations?\" This got me thinking about what my foundations are should I be impacted by something substantial.

Most of the best programmers I have worked with tended to be at the lazy end of the scale - they spend time thinking about the problems and looking for ways to automate tasks.\nLinks\nBe The Laziest Programmer You Can Be\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/lazyprogrammers/","title":"Lazy programmers can be the most productive"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/leaderseatlast/":{"body":"I really liked Simon Sinek's other books but didn't get into this one as much - don't get me wrong, it is still an excellent read and you can learn a lot. \n\nThe name comes from how officers in the US Marine Corp will eat last as opposed to most organisations where the leaders eat first.

I usually know it is time to move to a new role if I no longer enjoy it or I am no longer learning something new.\n\nJobWhat I learnt\nSkittlesWhen I was a teenager I set up skittles for 2 local teams. It's a bit like ten pin bowling but with 9 bins and large rubber balls; and my brother and I had the role to replace the pins as they were knocked down each time. For a men's match that could be in the order of 600 in about an hour. I learnt a lot of words I probably shouldn't as well as it is horrible working in a very smoky environment - this was before the ban on smoking in public places.\nFushard DiscoMy brother ran a mobile disco for about ten years and I used to \"roadie\" for him. I learnt that I could lift things heavier than I thought and that testing if a speaker is working by sticking your ear directly in front of it is not a good idea.\nPilton Cabinet WorksEvery Saturday morning for about 8 years I swept up the sawdust and rubbish at a place that made custom handmade high end reproduction furniture. The first week I did it it took me 4 hours and I was paid £3. This later rose to £5 when my brother helped and we shortened the time. We would pick up between 15 and 25 dustbin bags of sawdust.I learnt that sawdust is unpleasant and it can make you sneeze for 30 minutes non-stop (which hurts). I also found out that I could do manual work that was not necessarily fun.\nDe VereWhen I was at school I did a mock interview with a company that made large photographic enlargers. It went so well they offered me a job during the summer. I had to cycle for about an hour each way, up some pretty steep hills, and then spend the day soldering electronics to boards for 8 hours a day.I learnt that I am rubbish at soldering. I had 6 boards to produce. By the end 3 didn't work, one actually caught fire and 2 just about worked. I decided a life in software rather than hardware like my dad and brother was the path for me.\nMarks and SpencerWhile at college I would spend an hour each day stacking the fridges and freezers at Marks and Spencer. I learnt that I am a morning person, that the quickest thing to stack was Chinese style chicken and even in Devon people would fight over which turkey they wanted at Christmas. I also learnt that doing work before college every day impacted my results.\nALSThis was my first real job out of university. This means I learnt a huge amount about what a real job is - the stuff they don't teach you. I also learnt a lot about life. In the job itself the main skill I learnt was to debug programs. When I started there we would make the changes on a very old PC and then have to blow the software on to something called a \"prom pack\". This was effectively burning it onto a chip. This was then inserted into a terminal where we could then test the changes.It took between 15 and 30 minutes from the point you completed the change to when you could see the results. This was also before the days of real debuggers so we had to rely on interpreting the code as we looked at it and random print statements. There was an art to tracking down issues and it taught me well for my subsequent career.\nHISHIS was a consultancy that covered a number of industries. I was an introvert and to step into a consultancy role was a massive step and one I forced myself to do. I learnt how to cope with very steep learning curves when placed regularly in different roles and also the confidence and people skills required to be a consultant. It certainly didn't happen overnight but it had a huge impact on me personally.\nAtrialThis was the first company I was involved in starting. Four of us started it and grew it to about 40 people before a change in the market caused it to implode. I learnt how to pick up programming languages and sectors very quickly (I programmed in about 10 different languages). I also became the engineering manager for all the technical staff so I had to learn quickly how to manage people and projects. I gave it my best shot and I did okay but I also learnt that I still enjoyed coding more.\nEvolution/DeticaI joined a consultancy in the city. My first project was a placement as a Sharepoint expert where I hadn't even used it a week before. The project was a success but it was a huge challenge. I did a number of projects there for various financial institution so I learnt about working in finance and the city.\nBluecrestI joined a hedge fund and an incredible technical team. The ability of this team was head and shoulders above any I had worked with previously. I learnt so much from a technical perspective about distributed systems and how to scale them. We were using stream processors and column databases even before they had been released to production. I also learned the value of culture and leadership. Towards the end of my time there the CTO left and he was replaced by someone else, who was not up to the job. The culture changed completely and nearly 20 people left within a month or so.\nRBSMy first role as a contractor so there was everything related to that that I learnt. This was my first real encounter with a \"pure\" agile project with pair programming, test driven development, retrospectives etc. so I learnt about the good and the bad of this approach. I am glad I had this introduction as it was a good learning exercise but also allowed me to form my own views on what does and doesn't work.\nEndelecAnother startup only this time very short lived. We tried to develop a ground-breaking product for a customer but were undermined by some unbelievable office politics. I learnt that sometimes people are more concerned with their \"empires\" than the overall good of the company.\nCredit SuisseI was involved in developing a front end for a risk platform. This involved developing a data grid pretty much from scratch as the requirements could not be met at the time by existing options. I learnt that sometimes it is better to change the requirements than try to meet them - it became too complex and unwieldy and a simpler solution would have been better - although it did sort of work. I also learned about the impact of stress when it took a toll on my manager at the time.\nMorgan StanleyWith this role I was one of a team of four. Within about six months I was left on my own to support a trading desk completely without any support. I learnt that it is a huge responsibility and you have to learn every aspect of the system to a high level. I learnt that every change needs to be checked multiple times and also that you can earn the respect of traders (well some of them).\nBNP ParibasThis was one of my least favourite roles. There was a lot of red tape and very little trust. You had to check in and out every day and make sure you did a set number of hours and the IT support team wielded all the power which meant development was very difficult.\nMorgan StanleyBack at Morgan Stanley I was the technical lead for a front end for a trading platform. The biggest thing I learnt here was that helping someone learn can make a huge difference. I was able to mentor and teach one of the more junior developers. I won't take full credit for it as a lot of the success came down to this developer having the right mindset to learn and take advice on board.\nCIBCThis was my first real encounter with a web front end project. I was taken on to do a Windows front end and between accepting and starting they changed direction. It was okay but I was unable to convince them to use a web framework that has subsequently been shown to be more successful and easier than the one they picked as I didn't have enough relevant experience to influence the decision. I learnt that sometimes you might end up in the wrong place but you can still make an impact and do your best.\niov42And now to my current role. I have learnt a lot about architecting large distributed systems. I have learnt a huge amount about company/team culture and the importance of it. I have learnt a lot about managing engineers and projects and also a lot about start-ups and the do's and don'ts of running them. And I am still learning ...\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/learningsfromjobs/","title":"Learnings from my jobs"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/learningtodo/":{"body":"It is easy to decide that you can't do something.\n\nWhen we encounter something difficult or what we deem to be beyond our ability we often say we can't do it.

Or maybe it will take more effort than we want to put in. This change of mindset, where the focus is on learning rather the final end goal, means that any progress can be seen as a success.

And yes, I am an introvert.\nIn an interview with Jane Travis she said\n\nLearning without action is just entertainment\n\nI have been going back and forth on whether I agree with this. If my learning is aimed at personal development or maybe a business I am working on then reading a book or watching something without taking the action needed to backup that learning could potentially be classed as \"just entertainment\". \nWith this type of subject matter, where there is a purpose behind it, there is an expectation that what is being learnt should be put into action to benefit from it.\nHowever a lot of it is just learning for fun - maybe learning about a subject that I didn't know much about  or covering something that maybe useful one day. I might read, listen or watch something because I like the subject or it has been recommended to me. In all these cases there is not necessarily a direct action required but I would also not purely class it is entertainment.\nMaybe what she says is true but that is definitely not a bad thing - in fact I think it should be encouraged.

One type of asset we support is what we call a \"unique asset\" - it is an asset that has a unique value. This could be a painting, a car or, in the case of this document, a horse. \nIn the world of computing, it is a running joke that one of the most difficult tasks is naming things. Developers can spend a long time choosing what to name something. We also see this in the world of products and business. There are companies that specialise in helping others name things.\nAnyway, back to the document. When the document was written the horse used in the examples needed a name. In a moment of inspiration that would have a ripple effect, he was named \"Trevor\". From this point on, every example of a unique asset involved \"Trevor the Horse\" and it set a precedent for future, internal, documentation - it was okay to add humour and make it fun.\nSince then we have had a document about structured assets written in the style of Star Wars where every example has a Star Wars theme. We have also had a document about rotating cryptographic keys written as a fairy tale.

We dropped her off at Exeter University as she is about to embark on a four year adventure studying psychology.\n\nWhen you have children, everyone tells you that time flies and before you know it they will be grown up. And you nod and agree and then think you still have lots of time with them. Well, eighteen years later you realise that actually their advice was spot on and you hope that you have made the most of that time.\nOver the past year in particular we have tried preparing for this moment. We have made sure that we have spent time together, at home and on holiday. We have tried to teach her some of the skills she will need including cooking and cleaning. However we could see a subtle shift in her as her friends became a more and more fundamental part of her life and in particular being out more including more socialising in the evenings. This both reassured us that she was ready for the next step but also drove home how little time we would have with her before she moved out. \nNo matter how prepared you think you are, you are not prepared.\nOur family is pretty close. We have very few issues (well, that is what I think) and we are lucky that the kids get on well - we also have a 15 year old son. We were worried that he would be hit hardest as his sister is not only a sister but also probably his best friend. He loves spending time with her and getting her attention, even if it is just to annoy her. He just enjoys being a part of her life.\nWhen we dropped her off we travelled down on the Saturday and helped her move in and get organised. We then deliberately left her to it and stayed about 15 miles away. On the Sunday we met up again to do a food shop, get any last minute missing things and then to have a meal together before we travelled back home. This staggered drop off helped ease the transition a little.\nLeaving her there was very tough - she had been a daily part of our lives at home for eighteen years and now she would no longer be there. Admittedly it is much better now than when I was at university as we have Facetime and WhatsApp and all these other ways to keep in touch however it is not the same as having her around.\nWe all struggled with leaving her - but especially our son. Unprompted by us he wrote her the most amazing letter expressing his feelings and left it for her to read after we had left. There were lots of tears when she read it but it was great that he told her exactly how he felt.\nOne of my colleagues at work said this:\n\nThey talk about a child moving out like a bereavement, a sense of loss and with that associated grief … so no surprises that you are all feeling this way.\n\nI think it summed up our feelings very well. We still have moments where tears flow and there is sadness. We have a massive gap at home but we are also happy that she has got the opportunity she has. She worked so hard to get her A Level results and she deserves this chance. We are very proud of her. We are happy that she has settled in well, already made some friends and has the chance to study a subject that she has grown to love.\nShe is ready for this next step and hopefully so are we.

When the Sinclair ZX81 came out he bought one and this was my first contact with a home computer. This was soon joined by it's successor the Sinclair ZX Spectrum. At one point we had four of these in the house. We also had a BBC Micro, a BBC Electron and they were later joined by the ill-fated Sinclair QL and one of the first Amstrad PCs.\n\nI wrote my first ever program on a ZX Spectrum. I had typed in a bunch of programs from magazines but this was the first time I had written something from scratch. It was to move a character left and right on the screen and the key insight was to put a space either side so that it would rub out where it was before. I remember that moment of discovery clearly and going into my parents bedroom to wake them up so I could show them. I was much more excited about it than them.\nMy skills developed and I did a few school projects on it. One of them was winning a prize for religious education by writing a program to explain and draw a bunch of key terms we were learning. The school didn't have any Spectrums so the teacher had to come to my house to view it.\nI ended up doing a degree in Computer Science and now have over thirty years of commercial programming experience but it all comes from that initial ZX Spectrum.\nIn about 2003 (I would guess) I was working for a consultancy I helped to start. We won a piece of work to develop one of the first online poker games. We were dealing with some of the top players in the UK and an American who was one of the top players in the world. It was a challenging project - we developed a full 3d view of the card room and animated the dealing etc. while backed by a scalable backend, and this was in the days before Unity and the cloud.\nAs part of the project they wanted us to experience what it was like to play in a poker tournament so they signed us up for one in the basement of some casino in London. It was actually quite nerve wracking - playing against some top players when you have no idea what you are doing and they even show their disapproval at your lack of ability to shuffle and deal.\nHowever the highlight for me was that one of the people playing was Sir Clive Sinclair - the creator the aforementioned computer. I got to, sort of, meet and play poker against someone who changed the direction of my life. \nUnfortunately the combination of my lack of skills and his better skills meant that our paths diverged quite quickly and I wasn't able to speak to him and say thank you however it is nice to think that I at least got to meet him ... and help him win some money I guess.\nAnd yes I have the ZX Spectrum t-shirt.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/lifechanger/","title":"Life changer"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/load-balancing-algorithms/":{"body":"Sometimes you come across a post that is so brilliantly put together you have to share it - and I am not talking about any of my posts. \nThis post walks the reader through the different algorithms used by load balancers and the pros and cons of each approach.

A decision is made at a point in time about the features to develop, how long they will take and the order they will be done.\nAt the beginning when the roadmap is made there is incomplete information. There is little knowledge of what will be involved or how the product/market will develop. So assumptions have to be made when not only defining the tasks but also the priorities. It does not take into account the fact there is uncertainty in how features will develop and their priorities may change. Tasks could take longer or the market could change and these will impact the roadmap.\nThe roadmap is presented to all the stakeholders and often set in stone. Once this happens it can be difficult to change.\nA wider audience can make it more difficult to change as there is an expectation and possibly a series of dependencies. This is the reverse of the scenario where people are overcoming an addiction or taking on a new habit. In these cases they are encouraged to include a wider audience as a level of accountability. This wider accountability of the roadmap restricts the flexibility to adjust the tasks and the order they will happen.\nHe highlights that when implementing the roadmap there can also be a level of guilt in terms of having to do stuff that has been placed on it and putting off more important work. This will depend on the flexibility of how the roadmap is followed.\nHe proposes the idea of options as features that may or may not be implemented but the decision is made one cycle at a time. This leads to a level of flexibility in that the most important option can be selected when there is the most relevant information. This implies that you can always pick up the most important/relevant task each time.\nI think the ability to pick options over a roadmap is dependent on the product being developed and the stage it is at. If the product is relatively mature and the options are short and easily defined then there is more scope for following this approach. If the features are larger and have dependencies outside those developing the features then the flexibility is reduced.\nI think there is an opportunity to get the best of both worlds by defining roadmaps but holding them loosely and making sure all the stakeholders understand that it gets regularly reviewed and is expected to change. Regular reviews and an expectation of change can benefit all involved as the stakeholders know that if things change then the features they are dependent on have the opportunity to move up the roadmap and be delivered earlier.\nThe company I work for has just defined a roadmap for the next twelve months. This will give us some direction and focus - something we have been lacking until now. However I completely expect it to change and there is an expectation amongst all involved that when we look back in a years time we will see a significantly different path to the roadmap we have in place now.\nLinks\nOptions, Not Roadmaps\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/looselyheldroadmap/","title":"The loosely held product roadmap"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/luminarneo/":{"body":"I am not a photographer.

Together we have experienced some serious ups and downs in the company we work for and also personally. We have each reached a point where we were close to leaving; we have each had something happen in our lives where the others have supported us.\n\nWe used to do this via a WhatsApp group called \"Accountabilabuddies\" where we would not be afraid to commit to things and call each other out. There have been some very blunt chat messages and subsequent conversations triggered by this group. We still do this however we also have a regular, mostly weekly, check in where the three of us make a point to catch up.\nTo drive this we use a simple spreadsheet which has a number of sections that cover our work and the company we work for as well as how we are interacting and how we are each feeling. We call it \"measuring success\".\nWithin each section are a series of columns with statements that we then score between 0 and 5.\nThe company sections currently include: \n\n\"North star\" (the company direction and execution)\n\"Route to market\" (we're a start up, so how we get to revenue)\n\"Sensible sales\" (how well our pipeline is working)\n\"Management team\" (the composition and interactions)\n\"People\" (the right people and how are they)\n\"Communications\" (the effectiveness, audience and frequency)\n\nThese are very geared to the structure of the company, how we work and where we are in our journey. \nOur personal section includes:\n\n\"The Company and Us\" (our interactions with the company)\n\"Our interactions\" (the interactions between the three of us)\n\"Overall\" (how we feel about our role, the company and our work)\n\nThis  is the most useful section and we have regularly called each other out over something having been triggered by these discussions.\nWe will probably review all these sections and questions again soon and come up with new and more relevant topics as our journey and roles have progressed. \nThere are a few things that we have learned from doing this over the past year.\nThree is the magic number\nWe are all working remotely and there are certain limitations due to the logistics of conference calls. With three people we can have a pretty natural conversation where everyone takes part and there is not a lot of talking over people. As the number of people grows on calls it becomes more difficult and also some people tend to take a step back and become less involved. Having been in hundreds of conference calls, three seems to be close to the optimum number.\nAdditionally, as the number of people increases the amount of time taken to review the answers increases. We have found that we can get through reviewing all the answers in about half an hour. We focus on any values that have changed and ask the person who filled it in to explain why it has changed. Sometimes we will add comments on values that haven't changed yet to raise points we think are worth discussing.\nThree people also has the advantage that you don't end up with taking sides and stalemate. It may be that it ends up two \"against\" one in a discussion - and we tend to use that as meaning someone needs to take something on board - however you don't end up with a split with two lots of two people with opposing views. We are always able to reach a consensus.\nOpenness\nI don't think this process would work well unless there is a certain amount of openness and the trust between those involved to say what needs to be said. We each know that what we say is in confidence but also is meant with the right heart - there is no maliciousness and it is always meant as positive feedback. \nWe may try this soon with some of the engineers who work at the company and it will be interesting to see how well it works and if they have the same success and the same openness. It may take a while for them to benefit and I am not sure every single person will buy in but it will be interesting to find out. We would also certainly come up with a different set of questions and sections.\nTrends\nRecently my scores for my enjoyment of my role had dipped. This was due to a number of factors - some down to me and others down to external company factors. The other two were able to see this trend, highlight it and we discussed it. My role was tweaked a little and my enjoyment improved. As my role had changed over time I hadn't seen how it had impacted my enjoyment as I was too close to it and the change was gradual. I am thankful that they picked up on this and we were able to address it.\nThere are lots of \"company surveys\" out there but I am not sure how successful they are. They tend to be aimed at larger groups and don't always lead to discussions. We could role something like that out for the whole company or the whole team however as mentioned above, there needs to be a level of discussion and openness. The people taking part need to feel their answers will be taken seriously and that they can answer how they want - they don't have to worry about how they might be interpreted or how it will reflect on them.\nI am currently thinking how we could use a form of this with the team and this might consist of breaking them up into groups of three. There will probably need to be some serious thought around the questions and also how we can build the trust and openness. If we can pull it off then I think the benefits could be huge however it is certainly not a given. The team we have are very open to trying things and if they work then great and if they don't we either tweak it or throw it away. This could be one of those scenarios.\nCould you find two people to do this exercise with? \nCould you identify key areas in your life that you could measure?\nMaybe you could measure (and build) success too - whatever form that takes.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/measuringsuccess/","title":"Openness, discussions and success"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/meetingasynchronicity/":{"body":"Every couple of weeks we have a meeting called \"FriYay\". Based on a rota, each department has the opportunity to own one of these and present what they are celebrating.\n\nSometimes it becomes more of an update on what a department has been up to however it serves the purpose of keeping those not directly involved with them up to date with what they have been doing. It is a chance for a department to share their successes with others - not bragging, just enjoy sharing.\nFor me, one of the other main reasons for it is a chance for everyone to see everyone else. It is not always about what is presented but it is the few minutes of social banter at the beginning or the few people who stay on at the end to chat when it is over. It is seeing the faces of colleagues who are part of the same company but you have no other work reason to catch up with.\nIn these times where we are working remotely it is important to sometimes have that face to face interaction with others.\nA couple of my colleagues have proposed an alternative approach where a tool like Loom is used to pre-record the presentation. This would replace the FriYay call and people can watch it at a time that suits them.\nThere are a number of advantages to this as it means people can watch the update at the best time for them - for example, they don't have to interrupt their flow to attend the meeting. It also means they can potentially watch it speeded up so it takes less time.\nNow, I am not a meeting fan - I try to avoid them if my attendance is not fully required - however I am not completely sold on this fully asynchronous approach. For some meetings it may make sense but for others, the interaction of people is sometimes as important as the message. Admittedly, if your role involves you being on calls or meetings all day then you are getting a lot of interaction however not everyone has that sort of role.\nIt was suggested at one point to move our team stand-ups to this approach where the engineers could record their progress at any point in the day and post their updates. I pushed back on this as we don't have a lot of meetings/calls and for me the interaction of those involved is a massive part of the reason for the stand up.\nAs part of the stand up, we introduced a weekly question on Monday which gives each team member the chance to share their views or opinions on something. One of the team will pick the question and share it. These have included questions about life, about those involved, about opinions - it is a chance for people to share a little bit from outside work - a chance sometimes to be a little bit vulnerable.\nI certainly would not propose every meeting be done asynchronously, mainly for the reasons I have given above but there may be some types of meetings where it makes sense. \nOne proposal is to also use this approach for another meeting which is mostly a leadership update. It routinely consists of each person presenting about their department and they run one after another. This could be an example where this could be done completely asynchronously and the leaders could meet up just to discuss the important stuff and make decisions. I know at least two people involved in the current approach who are keen to make this happen.\nIt will be interesting to see how this develops. Maybe I will change my mind ...\nLinks\nLoom\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/meetingasynchronicity/","title":"Should meetings be asynchronous?"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/meetingcosts/":{"body":"We had a meeting recently with 16 people on the video conference call.

And I'm thinking, ok ... some of the smartest people in the world in this field wrote this paper. It got through the standards of our top journal, and you a second year student think it's garbage. What's going on here? I think we have a culture where you learn that you signal your intelligence by tearing other people's work apart. And I think it often takes much greater intelligence to build an idea than it does to destroy it.\n\nI think the quote above could be extended to \"it often takes much greater effort to build something up than it does to destroy it\". A classic example is building - it can take months to build a building and only moments to knock it down.\nEarly in my career I would be very critical when reviewing other peoples code - not of them directly, but of the code they produced. It wasn't me consciously trying to show my intelligence but looking back in hindsight there may have been an element of that - a need to justify my role. At the time the motivation was to ensure the code was as good as possible but I guess it could have been seen in another way.\nWe see this to an extent in the media, certainly the British tabloid press. It is much easier for them to be negative and critical of celebrities to sell their papers than to be positive and build them up. \nIt is also said that \"sarcasm is the lowest form of wit\". It can be very easy to make fun of someone in the form of sarcasm. It is much more difficult to say positive things about someone - it takes an effort to step outside some social norms. We can feel uncomfortable telling someone how great they are directly to them.\nFor me one of the turning points was coaching my son's football team. I coached them from the age of 7 to the age of 12. My aim was to always look for the positive in what they did and let them know. It was a conscious decision. If they did something wrong I would always try and put a positive spin on it in some way. I would be looking to encourage rather than discourage. Even now, I find it hard watching youth football coaches who shout at their players, criticizing what they have done even though I am sure the player did their best.\nWith the negative approach it can focus the attention on the person giving the criticism - they are putting down the other party, making themselves look better.

It would have been very easy to blame the person who made the release. For me, it was more important to identify why and how the mistake happened rather than who made the mistake. In this case, it was clearly an issue with our processes and checks.\nWhilst working on the fix, one of the team reached out to me and explained what they planned to do. I asked if he was just giving me an update or asking permission to deploy it? He explained:\n\nYes, it's our suggestion, but it's better with your green light. So if it catastrophically fails we can blame you.\n\nMy response was:\n\nThat is my main role. Taking the blame for things when they go wrong.\n\nThis was all said in jest but there is an element of truth to this.\nI expect all the engineers to have a level of accountability for the work they do - this helps drive them to do the best they can and be proud of what they do.\nHowever I am not averse to taking responsibility for handling issues when they occur - even if I was not directly involved in the cause of the issue. So if something goes wrong and it needs to be shared with those \"higher up\" or someone needs to own it then I am happy to take the \"blame\" for it. I will take responsibility for the actions of the team.\nOne of the main parts of my role is making it as easy and as enjoyable as possible for the engineers to do their job. This includes \"protecting\" them from the noise above them and this is just an example of that.\nNow the CTO has taken this on board and refers to it as a \"Blame Mark\" culture instead - apparently I am to blame for everything!\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/noblame/","title":"Blame me"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/novicepermit/":{"body":"When I feel I am no longer learning I know it is likely time for me to either look at how my current role can change or time to look for a new role.\n\nEugene Wei has a great way of phrasing this.

One of the things that I really like is the ability to add community plugins to add functionality as required.\n\nThese are the plugins I use the most:\nAdvanced Tables \nAdd improved navigation, formatting, and manipulation to markdown tables. I've not used this a huge amount but very helpful when doing anything with tables.\nDoubleshift \nOpen the command palette when you press shift twice. This is my main way of executing some of the other plugins/commands. Very handy and easy to use.\nFocus Mode\nRemove all the extra stuff from the display. I use this if I have a chunk of focused writing to do as it just leaves the note I am working on.\nIcon Folder \nAdd any custom icon (of type .svg) or from an icon pack to your folder or file. Probably not essential and more of a nice to have as it makes certain folders stand out more.\nKanban \nCreate markdown-backed Kanban boards. This is my go to approach for tasks. I have used it to track things to do and also things to take when travelling.\nNovel Word Count \nDisplay statistics about each file and folder. Another nice to have. I use it to display the number of notes in each folder, although it can do a lot more than that.\nPaste URL into selection\nInsert links (URLs) into a selected text. Definitely one of my most used plugins. Type some text, highlight it and then paste a url and it will convert it to a link.\nURL Namer\nRetrieves a web page title to name URL links. This is the reverse of the paste url plugin. I can paste a URL and then execute this and it will pull in the title from the url and convert it to a link.\nVarious Complements\nEnables you complete words like the auto-completion of IDE.

My team are scattered around Europe in various places and we only get together in person two or three times a year. These off-sites are precious and we try to use the time as productively as possible. \nEach off-site is usually two days and follows a similar format. \nThe first morning is a set of updates from various teams and management on different aspects of the company. The afternoon is usually a group exercise of some form followed by social events in the evening. The second day is devoted to each team having time to work on things face to face that they would not normally be able to do; for us this is usually brainstorming and discussing some technical problem or design.\nThe group exercise this time was called the \"1% exercise\".\nBackground\nIn 2003, British Cycling appointed David Brailsford as their performance director. From 1908 until the time he was appointed Britain had won one Olympic gold medal and no British cyclist had ever won the Tour de France. After his appointment, between 2007 and 2017, British cyclists won 178 world championships, 66 Olympic or Paralympic gold medals and 5 Tour de France victories.\nThey achieved this by focussing on marginal gains, the 1% changes.\nFor example, these are some of the varied changes they put in place:\n\nMore comfortable seat so they could ride longer\nRubbed alcohol on the tyres for better grip\nTested different massage gels for faster recovery\nWashing their hands to reduce risk of infection\nChanged pillows and mattresses to aid sleep\nPainted the inside of the truck white to show dust\nHeated overshorts for ideal muscle temperature\n\nSetting the scene\nThe group exercise we did was to try and identify any marginal gains we could make to the company to improve it. This could cover a number of areas:\nImproved culture - What can we do to improve our culture? What would make this a better place to work?\nLower Costs - How can we lower our costs to make the runway longer or to provide better customer value?\nMore Motivation - What can we do to improve your time at the company? What would make your role better? What would make you excited to work every day?\nMore Customers - What can we do to get more customers? Or get more sales leads? Or get better customers?\nImproved tooling - What software would make your role better/easier?\nImproved Productivity - What processes would improve productivity? What processes should we remove/change/add?\nBetter Product - What could we do to improve our products? (Features/performance/value)\nImproved Delivery - How can we deliver quicker? How can we deliver better? (Quality/performance)\nImproved Communication - How can we improve communications? - Internal and external, Meetings, emails, chats/documentation\nThe Exercise\nWe split into a number of groups with a mixture of people from different departments.\nStep 1 (~30 minutes)\n\nBrainstorm as many ideas as you can across all areas\nWrite them on post-it notes\nDo NOT worry about how feasible they are, if there are duplicates or organising them.\n\nStep 2 (~10 minutes)\n\nRotate around all the other groups answers and have a quick read of theirs\n\nStep 3 (~10 minutes)\n\nReturn to your original groups and capture any additional ideas that you have had based on other groups ideas (new ideas, not just copying them)\n\nStep 4 (~60 minutes)\nDiscuss the notes in the group and organise your ideas:\n\nRemove/rewrite duplicates\nOrganise the post it notes based on a graph of two axes: \n\nEase of implementation (easy - impossible)\nSize of impact (small - large)\n\n\n\nAlso keep a section for other ideas that don't fit for whatever reason so they will at least be saved.\nAfter this was completed we transferred the notes to Miro and pulled all the notes together into a single graph.\nThe flood of post it note ideas we produced:\n\nWe are now analysing the results to see what we can improve and make an impact.\nAs an aside, I think that a similar exercise could be performed by an individual or a family to identify areas that can be improved in their personal/family lives. \nMaybe something to try in future.\nLinks\nMiro\nMarginal Gains: This Coach Improved Every Tiny Thing by 1 Percent\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/onepercentexercise/","title":"The One Percent Exercise"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/onlinesafetybull/":{"body":"Imagine you wanted to send a message to a friend. The message has sensitive information so you want to send it securely. \n\nThey have given you a box which you can put your message in and a key to lock it. They own the only key that will unlock it - not even the key you used to lock it will open it. You have also given them the same sort of set up to send messages back to you. You happily send these messages and chat about what is happening in the world.\nUnfortunately the rulers of your kingdom think that you might be sending illegal messages, or at least saying horrible things about them, so they want to see everything you are sending. From the perspective of keeping the kingdom safe this sounds reasonable. However they can't open the box so they decide that the only way that may work is to look at the message before it is sent.\nThey decide that they will send over a robot they call a \"scanner\" to read your message before it is put in the box. One company tried this approach before but wrote it off as not possible for ethical and technical reasons. The rulers tell you it is okay as they know how to do it and not to worry as the scanner will be developed by a trusted company and won't share anything it reads with anyone else, well not much anyway - it will give a thumbs up or thumbs down to the message.\nThe scanner has to read the message, interpret what it sees and then decide. However its interpretation is not perfect and sometimes it will block perfectly legitimate messages. If a message is blocked it will notify the rulers that you are trying to send something and may end up with you not being able to send any more messages - it could even involve them reading the messages and deciding to take more serious actions. So your harmless message about the next door neighbours cat could end up with you being blocked if the alternative word you used for cat is misinterpreted.\nObviously the bad guys will try and read your messages so they will try and come up with schemes to do this. Maybe they could send you fake scanner; it looks like the real one but sends them all the messages instead. Maybe the fake scanner could threaten to send all your messages out unprotected unless you pay a ransom. Maybe someone could be peering through the window and looking at the message while the scanner reads it. \nAll the makers of the secure boxes decide that they don't want to be involved with this so they choose to no longer allow their boxes to be used in your kingdom. No-one is able to send any messages any more but the rulers are happy as there are no illegal messages being sent. \nThis may sound like fiction but this is effectively what the UK government is proposing with their Online Safety Bill. They want messaging companies to either remove encryption so messages are sent in a form that others could intercept and read or introduce a magical technology that will securely scan messages before they are sent. No-one has yet developed an approach to this that works and still keeps the messages secure. Experts in security and cryptography have raised concerns about this along with the technology companies involved. Regardless of this they are still ploughing ahead and vaguely waving their arms around claiming it will work with no evidence to back this up.\nWatch this space ...\nLinks\nOnline Safety Bill: Suella Braverman fails to understand encryption risk | Open Rights Group\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/onlinesafetybull/","title":"The Online Safety \"Bull\""},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/organisedchaos/":{"body":"I have mostly been working from my dad's workshop for the last week.\n\nThere is a stereotype of the mad inventor who works from his garden shed.

We get that rush when either we bring the item home or it is delivered. It is easy to form an addiction to that feeling.\n\nWhen the sales come around we might see something on offer that we think we would like - but had probably not considered before - and this is the time to take a step back and consider whether we really need it. This checklist below is something to consider for the next big purchase, ask ourselves these questions:\n\nCan I work around the problem with a repair, modification, or change in use?\nIf I buy this, what else am I not buying?\nCan I afford this?\nWill this item help me do things I can’t do now?\nWill buying this item significantly increase my enjoyment of X?\nHow often will I use this in the next year? In the next five years?\nWill this item become obsolete in the near term?\nIs this item repairable?\nDo I really need ‘the best’? What is a good second choice?\nCan I buy something used that will do the job?\nAm I supporting a business I know and like? Do our values align?\n\nTaken from this article: Buy less, do more with good enough gear.\nTaking each of these questions in turn, let's expand the thinking behind them ...\nCan I work around the problem with a repair, modification, or change in use?\nIt is very easy when something goes wrong to have the reaction to just bin it and replace it. This especially can be the case if it is technology based and the technology has moved on. It is very tempting to just get the latest new thing.\nI had this when my mobile stopped charging. I was very tempted to buy a new mobile to replace it however a quick trip to the local repair shop resolved it (and they did it for free). Even more recently the camera on the same phone failed. After lots of investigation it turned out to be a known issue with no fix other than to send it back to manufacturer. Due to my reliance on the mobile for work and also the potential cost I decided this time to buy a new one.\nWe now keep that mobile as a backup in case one of our other mobiles fails in future and we need an interim mobile while it is being fixed - a subtle change of use.\nIf I buy this, what else am I not buying?\nThis is the classic case of deciding if there is a better use for our money or could we buy something else instead which we need more? Most of us have a finite amount of money to spend on things and we can only spend it once. It can be very tempting to buy things we like rather than the things we need. Sometimes we need to take a step back and consider is this the best thing we can buy?\nCan I afford this?\nProbably one of the most important points. It is easy to buy something we can't afford if we have access to a credit card or we are offered some form of financing. The lure of delaying the payment or paying it back in small amounts can make the decision to buy easier but does not necessarily make it right. \nThis can go for small purchases right through to the biggest purchases like a house. In fact it is even more important the larger the purchase. It is tempting when we see a house that we love, or a car,  that is outside the price range we can afford and to justify to ourselves that it is just a little bit more. That is the point where we need to take a step back, try and remove the emotion and consider whether we can really afford it.\nWill this item help me do things I can’t do now?\nIs the item we are about to purchase just something that allows us to do something we can already do or is it something that will add something new to our life? And is it something that we really want to do?\nWill buying this item significantly increase my enjoyment of X?\nThe key word in this question is \"significantly\" and can also refer to much more than just enjoyment. Most purchases will give a short term high and may give some form of benefit such as doing something easier or quicker, however does the amount of benefit you gain justify the price and the purchase?\nI am currently considering upgrading the monitor for my computer. I would love to go for a 4k curved monitor however can I really justify that the purchase provides a significant enough benefit?\nHow often will I use this in the next year? In the next five years?\nThis is definitely something worth considering. \nIf we were to buy a new car and it was going to cost us 200 (pick the currency of your choice) per month then that may or may not sound like a lot depending on our circumstances. If we add in all the extra costs like petrol, maintenance, insurance and road tax then it may end up nearer 300 per month. \nHow may times will we use it in a month? Even if we use it every day that works out about 10 per day ... is that a justifiable cost per day given the amount we will use it?\nIf we are considering buying the latest gadget - how many times will we use it in the next year? How many years will it last and so how much will each use cost over the lifetime of the gadget? This reframing of the cost may give some pause for thought.\nWill this item become obsolete in the near term?\nThis is particularly relevant to the latest technology. If we buy the latest iPhone when will we deem it to be obsolete and feel the need to replace it? Will it actually be obsolete or is it just the case that we feel that is obsolete due to peer pressure or feeling the need to have the latest version?\nIs this item repairable?\nAn item being repairable is something that is very easy to overlook and not high on most people's list of decision making lists. However if we want to get value for money, and especially in current times, maybe it should be a major factor. Making a decision based on how easy it is to repair could have a significant impact on the lifetime cost of the item. This could be the cost of replacing a broken screen on a mobile or the cost to repair a car, depending on the choice we made these can differ massively. \nDo I really need ‘the best’? What is a good second choice?\nWhen purchasing something do we really need the top of the range choice or the absolute latest version? Would a cheaper or simpler option be sufficient? This is a decision that will need to be made with the head and not the heart.\nSimilarly, we need to consider the impact of taking the cheapest option as this may be cheap now but add up to higher costs, or not solve our needs, over the course of its lifetime.\nCan I buy something used that will do the job?\nIt is very tempting to always buy new. As an example, I love to read so I have shelves stacked with books. It is easy to go on to Amazon and buy a new book. For books that have been out for a while I now buy them second-hand. I try and pick the best quality I can get for a reasonable price and it means I am saving loads.\nSimilarly, do we really need that car to be new or could we pick up a better deal buying second-hand or nearly new?\nAm I supporting a business I know and like? Do our values align?\nThis was not a conscious step in my decision making process however it is something I think I considered subconsciously in some circumstances. There are some companies I will avoid due to their actions or their ethos and this has skewed my decision making in the past. Maybe this is something that will grow in importance going forward as we become more and more conscious of the world around us and the impact we are having on it.\nSummary\nAnd just to finish ... the aim is not necessarily to say yes to every single one but to be able to take a step back and be more considered when making purchases. And if when you come to make the purchase you feel uncomfortable in some way then it is probably for a reason and you might want to just take a moment to consider before going ahead.\nLinks\nBuy less, do more with good enough gear\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/pausingbeforebuying/","title":"Questions to ask yourself before you buy"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/perplexityai/":{"body":"I have tried to avoid writing about AI as everyone seems to be doing it however I have found one site that is pretty usable and actually seems to work quite well.\n\nperplexity.ai is billed as an AI search engine where you can ask it questions in plain English and it will then offer options for further questions based on the answer given.\nI've used it to look at potential places to visit in Croatia and which university my daughter should consider choosing for a psychology degree.\nThe answers aren't perfect by any means but I do like the way it proposes follow up questions to drill into more detail or take the session in different directions.\nIs it a game changer?

It might take a while to download as they tend to be between 4-8Gb.\nOnce loaded you will want to try it out. Click on the chat icon (3rd one down) on the left hand side.

Usually this can be solved by reloading the model from the dropdown or worst case restarting the application. Your previously downloaded models will still be available and don't need to be downloaded again - you just need to select the model before chatting as before.\nLinks\nLM Studio\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/personalai/","title":"How I learnt to run my own personal AI"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/photosinmapview/":{"body":"It is possible to see a (heat)map of all the photos you have taken in Google Photos.\n\nTo see this view, start the Google Photos app and then select \"Search\" at the bottom.

No exceptions. Don’t confuse kindness with weakness.\n\nI like both of these approaches.\nAs mentioned in my post on fatherly wisdom, I once worked with someone who said when he has a choice to make he will pick the one that is the most interesting. \nMaybe we pick one of these approaches or it is a combination of them, or maybe it is pick the one that is the most fun or the one that is the most challenging. Perhaps, picking an approach or at least considering them is the key part as opposed to which one.\nIn Build - An Unorthodox Guide to Making Things Worth Making by Tony Faddell, who developed the iPod for Apple, he discusses how to make career choices:\n\nSo when you’re looking at the array of potential careers before you, the correct place to start is this: “What do I want to learn?”\n\nFor me, this is a very important aspect of a job. I need to be learning something to make it interesting and enjoyable - but I guess you knew that.\nHe also suggests that you should follow what you are naturally interested in. It is easier to take risks when you are younger and you have less dependencies:\n\nThe best way to find a job you’ll love and a career that will eventually make you successful is to follow what you’re naturally interested in, then take risks when choosing where to work. Follow your curiosity rather than a business school playbook about how to make money. Assume that for much of your twenties your choices will not work out and the companies you join or start will likely fail. Early adulthood is about watching your dreams go up in flames and learning as much as you can from the ashes. Do, fail, learn. The rest will follow.\n\nAnother aspect to consider is who you will work with. The best roles I have had have been due to the people I have worked with and learnt from. He extends this to also consider making a dent in the world by doing something meaningful.\n\nWhat you do matters. Where you work matters. Most importantly, who you work with and learn from matters. Too many people see work as a means to an end, as a way to make enough money to stop working. But getting a job is your opportunity to make a dent in the world. To put your focus and energy and your precious, precious time toward something meaningful.\n\nI am sure I could find a whole bunch of other criteria to consider when picking a path.

They tend to be about 1000 pieces so they take a while to complete.\nMy daughter gave me a jigsaw as a present this year so I have just started it (a little later than normal). The classic approach seems to be to sort out the edges and do those first. This time I did that but also added some extra piles as I sorted through the pieces. One pile was for anything with trees on them, another was for sky, one for one section that is very vividly coloured and another for a set of red London buses that was quite distinctive.\nThe use of these piles should speed up the solving of the puzzle as it should allow for more focused solving of areas and also less repetition in looking at pieces.\nThere is also a theory that piles can be used as a way to speed up decluttering. By putting everything that needs sorting in one pile and then splitting that into smaller piles it can make the job much more manageable. \n\nI have used a very similar technique for my filing. I collect all my stuff to be filed in one pile over a number of months. When the pile gets annoyingly high I then go through it, sorting the paper into sections - utilities, mobile, bank, etc. I have found that using this approach gets me over the hump of procrastination of putting off a task I really don't like.\nIn some ways, you could also view folders on computers as just piles of files - or maybe it is taking things too far.\nLinks\nI Tried the “Pile Method” and decluttered in 12 Minutes | Apartment Therapy\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/pilingandorganisation/","title":"Piling and Organisation"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/planningworkshop/":{"body":"We have just completed a two week exercise with the whole development team to identify, design and estimate the next phase of work. It started as an organic process as we found the best way to do this and then developed into a repeatable process for the latter functionality.\n\nBefore starting on the individual breakdowns we produced a list of things to consider for everything we were estimating. This mostly consisted of a list of functional requirements like logging, testing, documentation, etc. as sometimes these can have a significant impact on the work.\nThe first step was to break down the work into \"EPICs\". For us these are the deliverables to the business. At the completion of each of these we should be able to demonstrate a significant piece of functionality.\nFor each of the EPICs we then generated high level user stories and also acceptance criteria at the EPIC level. We set in stone that we could not move on to generating the backlog of tasks and estimates until the whole team agreed on both of these. These could be revisited if needed if the next step revealed any changes were required.\nOnce these had been agreed we discussed the tasks involved in each of the stories. If the story was small enough we would not break it down any further at this point however we would still agree what would be involved in the implementation and make note of any important points.\nFor larger stories we broke these down into smaller tasks. In most cases this created three to four tasks.\nThe next step was estimation. The team decided that they wanted to use story points. To achieve this we went through the process of looking at the work we had done previously and identifying tasks that took a similar amount of work and were differing sizes relatively to the rest. \nWe identified three tasks for each of 1, 3 and 8 story points. When we get to estimating these provide a way to compare with what is being estimated and gauge relative size.\nFor the estimating itself we used a Slack plugin called Pokerbot with Fibonacci story points. This actually worked really well. For each task every developer would use this to vote in secret. We displayed the comparison tasks while voting was done.\nAt this point we also reminded them to consider the earlier list of things to consider.\nOnce all the votes had been cast we used the following rules:\n\nWe only accept a vote with adjacent scores (only 1's and 2's, only 5's and 8's, etc.)\nIf there are non-adjacent scores, start by asking the small outliers \"what work is involved?\" Then ask the large outliers \"what [other] work is involved\"? And then do a revote for the whole team.\nIf you have adjacent scores, but 2 or more are the higher number, take the higher number.\nIf you have adjacent scores, but only 1 of the higher number, they get to choose between the two numbers.\nFor the question mark option: Use it sparingly, but it lets someone ask a question and force a revote\nInfinity: Something's gone wrong. It's the wrong work, or can't be done.\n\nWe generated estimates for each task and then summed them to produce estimates for each story.\nThe last step is to take these and map them to dates for reporting to management. To achieve this we needed to generate an initial velocity value that will obviously change as the project progresses. \nAs a one off we did this by estimating in days how long some of the tasks would take and then mapping these to the story points to get the initial value.\nThe thing that amazed me most was how much the team bought into the process. Admittedly they are all senior level developers but they fully engaged in all the discussions and the process and, hopefully, we have a much clearer view on what we need to do and much better estimates (we'll see soon!).\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/planningworkshop/","title":"How to run a planning workshop"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/podcastswithbookmarks/":{"body":"I listen to quite a lot of podcasts.

If a user, Alice, locks the padlock with the private key then it can only be unlocked with the public key. Similarly, if Alice locks it with the public key it can only be unlocked with the private key.\nAlice must keep her private key private - she must be the only one who has access to it.

This means that the only person who can decrypt (unlock) it is Alice as the only key that can unlock it is Alice's private key. So this means that someone can send Alice some data, or a message, that only she can read as she is the only one who can unlock it.\n\nSigning\nIf we reverse the process then we can get another useful feature. If Alice takes her private key and signs (locks) the data she can send it to anyone. If the private key is used then the only key that can be used to unlock it is the public key.

These tasks have been done numerous times by numerous developers around the world in different flavours.\n\nI came across someone who is absolutely pushing the limits of what is possible with C#. This article describes how they wrote a simple game in C# and then through a number of more and more obscure approaches managed to get the size of the self contained application from an initial  64MB down to an incredible 2KB. \nI am never likely to need to use many, if any, of the techniques it documents but it is firstly an incredible bit of technical work to show what is possible and secondly a very well written article explaining each step involved and why it was done.\nIn my first real job after university I was writing Pascal for a system that was used by public libraries all over Europe. The code would be compiled and then blown onto a physical prom pack that would then be slotted into a terminal to run the application. The application we produced had a number of different features and each library not only had their own combination of features but also their own localisation of the text.\nThis was back in the early 1990s so it was unusual to have to support localisation at the time and it was a nightmare doing the builds and the testing as each was unique.\nAnyway, one day they told me they needed to fit a combination of features that were much larger than could fit on the prom pack. The prom pack could handle about 768KB but the code when compiled was about 1300KB. My job was to try and get it to fit.\n\nThe first step was to replace the original Pascal compiler with a compatible optimising compiler (Stony Brook). This had a whole set of different flags that claimed to produce smaller and/or faster code. Unfortunately some of them, or at least some of the combinations of them, were buggy and would cause crashes. However with a certain amount of trial and error I managed to get it to compile and reduce the size by a chunk.\nThe next step was to go through the code and find ways to make it compile smaller. I found that the way it handled certain data structures could be tweaked to significantly reduce the code size. Along with a whole set of other changes I was getting closer to the target. I went through over 200k+ lines of code line by line and hand optimised it for speed. \nI got to the point where I was dreaming about it in my sleep.\nI got within about 30KB of the target when they decided that actually they didn't need all the features and I could stop optimising the code. I was glad to put that task behind me but also a little disappointed that I didn't quite hit the target.\nOn a side note, I  found out that the designer of the Pascal language, Niklaus Wirth, passed away this week. His language, Pascal, set the basis for my career.\nBack on topic, the distributed ledger platform that we are developing at the moment is another example where it is going beyond the normal. Some of the things we have had to design and implement are definitely not your \"run of the mill\" code. Pretty much every task is different from every other task and involves working out new ways of doing things.\nThere are definitely challenges in going beyond the normal - sometimes you don't even know if it is possible - but it is the challenge and the learning that can make things fun.\nLinks\nBuilding a self-contained game in C# under 2 kilobytes\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/pushingthelimits/","title":"Pushing The Limits"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/questionfocus/":{"body":"Questions are underrated.

This article explains the how and why of its death and interestingly what it could have been if it had fully achieved it's aims. The aim was to be a single place to consume not only articles but other forms of media as well.\nI used to follow over 150 different websites and it was great to be able to check all their new updates in one place. I would spend about ten minutes each day scanning all the titles to determine which were worth reading and then usually about another 5-10 minutes reading them. It was very efficient.\nThe day they killed Google Reader was a very sad day for me.\nI tried a number of alternatives including the most popular ones such as Feedly. However the one that seemed to most align with the way I wanted to use a reader was Inoreader. It is one of the few applications I pay a subscription fee for - I pay 20 euros a year for the supporter plan to make it ad free.\nI have the sites grouped into sections which means I can scan all the new related articles for a particular subject in one go. \n\nI select one section at a time and scan the articles, as before, and any I think are worth reading I \"star\" them to add them to \"Read Later\". At some point I will work my way through those articles.\nWith the demise of Twitter I think there may be an opportunity which could potentially lean on RSS for a solution. One of the reasons I still have Twitter is due to the kid's school using it to send out updates such as trip updates or sports results. \nAs they have no need for a lot of the features such as sharing or comments their requirements could be simplified to just the posting the same short updates using RSS. There are then a whole selection of applications that could be used to read it - any application that supports RSS.

Go for a circle around your neighbourhood and arrive back home to your home/remote office! It psychologically marks the start and end of the day.\n\n\nIf you are working from home then the easy option in the morning is to just go straight to wherever you are working and start work. I thought I would try his suggestion, especially as the weather is improving. So for the last couple of weeks I have helped shepherd the kids out of the door to school, waved goodbye to my wife as she goes to work and then gone for a short 20-30 minute walk either around the houses or to some of the fields close by.\nI put on my headphones and put on a podcast then start walking. I used to listen to a lot of podcasts, 100s per year, on my commute but have not been doing this since permanently working from home. I have got in to the habit of reading a lot but there are too many distractions at home for me to just sit and listen to something for a period of time.\nWhen listening to podcasts my mind tends to wander, based on what I am listening to, and some of my best thinking happens when I am walking and listening so it is great to get back into that again.\nIf I visit the fields then I have also taken to sitting on one of the benches for about 5 minutes, headphones off, just to relax, listen to the birds etc. and just take time to slow down. \nHas it made a difference? I guess the most important thing is that I have enjoyed doing it and it gets me out of the house - whereas before it was easy to potentially go the whole day without stepping outside. Not only am I getting some exercise, albeit only walking, but it has also given me time to think and brainstorm which is fun and, you never know, may lead to some flash of inspiration or wisdom at some point.\nLinks\nRemote commuting\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/remotecommuting/","title":"Commuting to my office at home"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/respectotherstime/":{"body":"Maybe it is my upbringing but I always try to be on time for things.\n\nI am usually the first person on a call or attending a meeting, often joining slightly early.

The idea of running each talk multiple times to suit people in different time zones was brilliant and the variety of subjects and presentation styles was great. No doubt this was challenging for the speakers however I was able to choose talks which suited my time availability.\nNearly every talk had a Q&amp;A session at the end driven by the chat channel linked to the talk. This proved much more useful than I expected. I was able to get a few specific questions answered after the talk.\nA couple of the sessions were more around skills - I did a sketchnoting one and a creativity one - and the use of chat here, particularly in the latter, really made the sessions engaging and helped build an energy to the presentation.\nThere was an article I read shortly afterwards that talked about rethinking the way online conferences are done. This proposed that the sessions could be spread out over a longer time period as there was no longer a requirement for people to travel and be in a specific place for a specific time. \nIt also suggested that the talks could be pre-recorded with a live Q&amp;A after with the speaker. For some sessions this would be great as it would mean that the speaker could prepare their answers while the talk is going on which could lead to a better engagement and answers. For Build, despite others being available to help, it often felt at the end that they were under pressure to find the questions people asked and try to answer them unprepared - with little room for curation and thought.\nI hope we are going to see conferences evolve and become even better experiences.

I've not read it yet but I came across a podcast where he was interviewed by Simon Sinek so it piqued my interest.\nWill Guidara took over the restaurant Eleven Madison Park and turned it into the best restaurant in the world. He did this by focussing on the experience, not just on the food. \nThere were a number of things that stood out for me (saved for a later post) but one in particular I will highlight here:\n\nWhat's the difference between service and hospitality? Service is black and white, hospitality is colour. Service is just doing the thing that you do with precision, accuracy, and efficiency. Hospitality is how you make the person who you're doing that for feel. In a restaurant, service is getting the right plate to the right person at the right time. Hospitality is the extent to which you've created the conditions for connection while you're serving them that plate.\n\nService is relatively easy to achieve. It is about doing things right and following processes. Hospitality takes effort - a combination of listening/observing and action - that goes beyond and focusses on the experience. It is about building memories and doing things different.\nThe church I attend have two teams of volunteers focussed purely on people. The welcome team are there, as the name suggests, to welcome people. This starts at the front door and goes all the way through the service and afterwards. People regularly comment on the welcome they get and how they are made to feel at home.\nThe second team is the hospitality team. They provide refreshments after the service and for the volunteers before the service (fresh croissants and sometimes bacon sandwiches). Each week they serve hundreds of teas and coffees. They are aided by a third team - the baking team - who provide home baked cakes and cookies each week.\nThis relatively small act of service, providing refreshments, provides an environment where people are encouraged to hang around afterwards and connect; a chance to discuss and chat rather than rush off.\nThe hospitality team also go the extra mile and live up to their name when there are special events. For mothers day they will decorate the area with fresh flowers, use white tablecloths, have a theme for all the cakes. For recent royal events they have displayed flags and use the colours as the basis for decoration.\nIt is also about the connection when they serve the drinks - looking people in the eye and engaging with them, not worrying about how quickly they need to serve people.\nService can be great but hospitality makes the difference.\nLinks\nUnreasonable Hospitality \nUnreasonable Hospitality with Will Guidara podcast\nRock Church\nAs an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/serviceandhospitality/","title":"The difference between service and hospitality"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/sharedmeetingdocument/":{"body":"We have a lot of remote meetings as most of our team work a significant amount of time from home. Face to face meetings are much better for some types of meetings - especially workshops and retrospectives. As the level of expected collaboration increases the more it favours face to face interactions.\n\nWe have also been far from optimal in capturing information from meetings and discussions. We have tended to capture the actions fairly well but have failed to adequately capture the \"why\" - i.e. why were certain decisions made or approaches followed.\nWe had a recent meeting where we all collaborated on a shared Google doc as the meeting progressed. This worked really well for this particular meeting. We have decided that for nearly all meetings we will create a shared document with an expectation that all participants will update it as it progresses.

Rather than typing it in, maybe you could speak it or point the camera at a price and it could convert it for you. You could go into a shop and compare prices very quickly. \nWould people use it if this was it's only feature?\nPossibly, but I am sure if it became popular someone else would develop the same app and add more features to become a \"holiday app\" they expect the user to want. It could support checklists for packing, links to useful websites for trips and restaurants, a wallet to keep all the flight details, a way to organise your holiday snaps, etc.\nVery quickly this goes from a very simple application to a world of complexity. \nWhy do we expect all our software to contain lots of features?\nOver time there is pressure to add features and complexity to the software - from internal and external parties. There is pressure to add new features to make the software more attractive to potential customers or to match the features of potential rivals. There is pressure from users as they have grown accustomed to features being added over time; they wonder if the software is still being maintained or worth using if it has not been updated for a while.\nDavid Heinemeier Hansson (DHH) discusses this in a recent post . \n\nIt's hard to sell simple, because simple looks easy, and who wants to pay for that? Of course, everyone says they want something simple, but the way they buy reveals that they usually don't.\n\nHe links this to the current focus on people subscribing to software, paying a monthly fee, to use it and get the latest updates. \nIn the \"old days\", you used to buy effectively a snapshot of the software on disk and that was the version you used from that point on. If you wanted a new version you would have to buy a completely new version and install it. \nOnce software started to be distributed over the Internet it was possible to push updates to software that you could download; you would get the small updates for free and then pay for the next \"big\" version.\nWith the introduction of web based software it was now possible for users to use the latest version of the software which meant that there was limited opportunities for additional fees. Some worked around this by getting customers to pay for certain features. However this is where subscriptions were born.\nUsers became renters of software, paying a rental fee each month and never actually owning the software.\nDHH explains it like this:\n\nThere are rarely high margins in actually selling someone something that they then own. Much better to rent it to them. They'll own nothing and you'll convince them they should be happy. By what sorcery? Fear, mostly. Vanity, sometimes. Sloth, occasionally. Pride, definitely. The more insecurities the merchants of complexity can trigger, the easier the sell.\n\nHe has started developing software from once.com that you buy once and then own from that point on. It still gets updated but there are no ongoing subscriptions. Will it take off? We will have to wait and see; hopefully it will at least get people to rethink the subscription model.\nLinks\nMerchants of complexity\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/simpleversuscomplex/","title":"Simple versus Complex"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/sketchnoting/":{"body":"One of the talks I attended at the Microsoft Build conference was called \"Sketchnoting 101\" and given by Nitya Narasimhan.

As they become comfortable and more knowledgeable in an area they will naturally gravitate to picking up tasks related to it. The need to deliver as quickly as possible can also drive this as the person who knows most is likely to be the person who can do the work quickest.\n\nOver time this can lead to a situation where knowledge of the project becomes \"siloed\" (isolated) - each person has their own areas of expertise and there is less and less cross-over and sharing of other areas. This leaves the project massively exposed if a person leaves or is on holiday. It can also add delays as tasks on the critical path may hold up other tasks while the person who can do them is working on something else.\nThe team I am currently leading took a different approach. They insisted that people pick up tasks in areas they know nothing about. This was difficult to buy into as a leader who has a project to deliver however we have a culture of try things and if they don't work change them. My concern was a natural one that this would mean that the project would be delivered more slowly.\nIn the beginning of the work it definitely had that effect. Each person was free to choose any task they wanted and were actively encouraged to pick up a completely different task than the ones they had done before. \nProgress was slower and there was pressure to deliver faster. However over time this has turned from being a negative into a massive positive. Every member of the team can now pick up any task which means we are no longer as exposed to people leaving or holidays. Productivity has soared as everyone knows the whole project and can help anyone else with what they work on.\nPeople feel bought in and they feel they are contributing. They can engage fully in all the discussions. There are naturally some areas where someone is stronger however one of the key objectives is to pass on that knowledge so others can get up to speed on it.\nAt the beginning I was definitely sceptical but I am now a complete convert to this approach.

It can be very daunting when attempting something new especially if it is potentially a large task. However it is impossible if you don't take the first step.\n\n(By the way, I am not advocating eating elephants - just to be clear)\nSeth Godin wrote an article recently called \"The 100 hour asset\".  In it he explains that by focusing 100 hours on a rare skill you are likely to acquire it - or certainly to a level more than most. This investment of time would put you well ahead of your peers. The commitment to learn the skill is something most people will not do and by you doing so will give you a noticeable advantage.\nHe then goes on to suggest that you could go a stage further. Investing twenty hours per week will give you one thousand hours of knowledge and put you in a new category. \nThe difficulty for most people is not access to the knowledge - it is the commitment to invest time in acquiring that knowledge. \nSo, is there something you could or need to make a commitment to learn? Is there something that will get you ahead in your career or something that will improve your life in another way? It could be a hobby you have always wanted to take up.\nThe prospect of investing twenty hours in a week is like eating an elephant for most people. However as the quote says, it takes a small bite to get started. \nThere is a training plan called \"Couch to 5k\" which is an exercise plan spread over a number of weeks to get someone from sitting on the couch to running 5km in one go. It does this by starting with very small first steps and gradually building it up over time - it doesn't jump to 5km from day one.\nSo, how much time do you think you could set aside to acquire that knowledge or skill that would make a difference? Maybe you can invest one hour a day or maybe you need to start smaller and invest fifteen minutes. If you can't invest it every day then maybe you can invest thirty minutes every other day or two hours at the weekend. Over time you will hopefully be able to increase this, possibly only small increment at a time.\nWhichever path you take the regular investment of time will build that knowledge and make you stand out from those around you and hopefully open new opportunities. \nSo what are you going to willing to commit to invest in?\nLinks\nThe 100 hour asset\nCouch to 5k\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/standingout/","title":"Committing time to stand out from the crowd"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/startingsomethingnew/":{"body":"Most people struggle with the blank page and starting something new.

In an interview with Matthew Inman and Elan Lee they talk about the creation of the popular game \"Exploding Kittens\". \nOne of the issues they identified with a lot of other games was the number of rules and the length of the instructions. This proved a real barrier to people playing them. I can relate to this as we were gifted the highly rated game \"Ticket to Ride\". We sat down to try it and gave up as the instructions were too convoluted and involved more investment of time than we wanted - it has sat on the shelf ever since.\nAnyway, they spent a lot of time writing and rewriting the instructions for their new game. They came to the realisation that there are some fundamental aspects and then there are bunch of edge cases that need to be handled.\n\nInstead, you start with the core and you repeat it and you repeat it and you repeat the core of what the game is. Don't explode. Draw a card. Don't explode. Draw a card. Then you throw all your edge cases and all your weird stuff at the very end. That way people at least can get going without having to get mired in all of the details.\n\nHe goes on:\n\nDon't explode. Draw a card. Don't explode. Draw a card.\nAnd then there's the giant block that says stop reading. If questions come up, we're pretty sure all those questions are answered on the backside of this page, but you don't even need to read the backside until those questions come up. You've got everything you need. Go play.\n\nSo, they put all the really important stuff first and then actively encouraged the player to not bother reading the rest of the rules. Only when something unusual comes up in game play do they need to consult the rest of the instructions. This helps remove a big barrier to engagement with the game.\nTo an extent the quick start guides that come with most electronic devices and software take a similar approach. They quickly introduce the consumer to only what they need to get started. I do however like the approach taken above of explaining that they can actively ignore the rest until they need it.\nLinks\nExploding Kittens | Spark and Fire\nExploding Kittens game\nAs an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/stopreading/","title":"Stop reading ..."},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/storybank/":{"body":"Life is made up of stories.\n\nEmmy Sobieski mentions this in her interview for Stanford's eCorner podcast:\n\nYou won't believe all the stories you have from growing up, from your parents, from what you saw happen with your cousins, from different business stories.

Loewy had a huge impact on the 20th century with significant designs in multiple areas. He said humans are torn between two opposing forces: \n\nneophilia, a love of new things and \nneophobia, a fear of anything that’s too new. \n\nHe identified that success lies at the intersection of those two tensions. We like things that are surprising as long as they are also to a certain extent familiar.\nThis battle for balance leads to the cycles we see in a number of areas including music, fashion and even baby names. People pick something that is different but still similar to what they know. Over time that pick becomes more popular and in doing so becomes too familiar. People then look for the surprise and pick something that is different but still fairly similar. Over time the original becomes less popular and we get a bell curve of popularity.\nWe see this in so many areas. Software builds on the software before it in terms of interaction and features. It is very rare that a completely new genre or approach is immediately successful unless it builds on an existing paradigm. \nWe see company logos and websites go through these same cycles. Suddenly we get a burst of logos using similar typography or the same shapes. Or we see a load of websites using the same layout or theme.\nWe can hopefully use this to our benefit when designing things - whether digital or physical. We need to consider two main questions:\n\nHow do you balance familiarity and surprise? \nCan you engineer a familiar surprise?\n\nIf we can find that fine balance then we may be onto something special - until it gets replaced by the next big thing.\nLinks\nThe four-letter code to selling anything\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/surprisinglyfamiliar/","title":"Surprisingly familiar"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/sweetsmakeadifference/":{"body":"My daughter sometimes works as a waitress at the local Pizza Express. If she has a good night then sometimes she can earn more in tips than her wages (although that is not very often).\n\nIn the book 59 Seconds it quotes an experiment where changing the number of sweets and how they were given affected the tip at the end of a meal.\n\nIn the control condition, diners were unlucky enough to receive their bills without any sweets at all. A second group was given a single sweet. Compared to the control group, this simple gesture of kindness resulted in a measly 3 per cent increase in tips. A third group of customers received two sweets each, and, compared to the control group, gave 14 per cent larger tips. Not bad. However, here comes the really clever bit. In the fourth and final condition, the waiters were asked to present the bill to customers along with one sweet each, then, just as they were turning away from the table, reach into their pocket and quickly hand everyone a second sweet. In terms of sweets per customer, everyone ended up with exactly the same number of sweets as those in the third group. But psychologically speaking, this was very, very different. The waiter had just carried out an unnecessary and nice favour, and, because of that, tipping increased by an impressive 23 per cent. \n\nAnother article claims the following are some of the ways to increase the tip given (I have only picked out the ones that are positive for both the server and the person being served):\n\nIntroduce yourself - Customers tend to tip friendly servers more than they do less friendly servers. \nUse positive body language - One of the most effective ways to look friendly is to smile.\nRepeat the order - people like it when others subtly imitate them.\nGive compliments - receiving a compliment activates the same region of the brain that receiving money does. It also encourages spending.\nBe entertaining - A French study found that giving customers a card with a joke on it almost doubled the number of people who left a tip and increased the average size of each tip. \nGarnished check, please! - writing, and in some situations drawing, on the back of the check increases tips\nCall customers by name - servers got the customers’ names from their credit cards and thanked half of them by name when returning the credit cards and charge slips.\n\nMaybe she should try some of these if she doesn't already do them?

Nothing that interesting so far ...\nWe took one of those streams of work and then brainstormed what deliverables this might involve.

This exercise could also be done with normal post it notes. For the task we were looking at this produced about 45 notes and took only about 15 minutes - all of us adding notes at the same time.\nWe next started organising them into themes or features; some were obvious, some had dependencies and some required more clarification. We drew lines to show the relationships between them.\nOnce we had this rough outline and the clusters we could see there were potentially a lot of tasks and not all of them were relevant or achievable in the timescale, so we now had to reduce them to a manageable number. \nWe identified four categories of notes and introduced a colour to represent each of them:\n\nGreen - Must Have\nOrange - Nice to Have\nPink - One day\nYellow - Not relevant\n\nWe worked through each of the notes and colour coded them based on the above.\n\nOnce we had this, it was a relatively simple task to extract just those coloured green.

At one point, he meets one of the riggers who works on and designs the intricate equipment that is required for the performance of each show. He makes an observation about it being a balance between safety and the artistic appearance of the equipment. He is quickly corrected:\n\n\"You mean a balance between safety and the artistic? No! That is the most common misconception of what we do. There can be NO compromise on safety and NO compromise on appearance. We must be 100 per cent safe, all the time, AND 100 per cent aesthetic. And that is what makes it so challenging. That's what forces us to be creative no compromise!\"\n\nThey take a long time to ensure that not only is everyone totally safe but what they design becomes part of the show and doesn't stick out. In some ways it is still a balance but the balance is at the extreme with no compromises.\nWhen we are developing software there tends to be a balance between speed of development and quality, especially depending on how and where the software is used. If it is used in a life critical scenario then it tends to favour quality/correctness (hopefully!) over speed.\n\nIt can often be easy to quickly deliver something, a new feature for example, however it takes time to ensure it is correct, both in terms of development and testing. There is often a pull from the business to deliver something quickly and a pull from development, or QA, to ensure it is right.\nIn most cases it is worth spending a bit more time to ensure that it is right. \nThe amount that the balance tilts in one direction tends to be governed by how much people are willing to compromise on quality. If the quality has to be as close to 100 percent as possible then it will tend to take longer.\nWhen time is one of the axes it is very difficult, if not impossible, to have a perfect balance where at least one of speed and quality are not compromised.\nLinks\nThe Spark\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/thebalance/","title":"How I learnt about not compromising"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/thebestandworst/":{"body":"I have been to see two musicals in London in the last few months - one was the best and one was the worst I have ever seen.\n\nThree months ago I went to see \"Bat out of Hell\" which my wife had bought me as a present - quite ironic that she bought a Meatloaf present as she is vegetarian.

It is about identifying the \"why\" behind adding it - what does it actually add?\nWe experienced another example of the impact of AI on businesses. We were happily using an automated QA tool and then they decided to add \"AI features\". Some of the features were great however there was no optionality to this. If you wanted to continue using the tool then you had to include and pay for the AI features.\nUsing AI currently does not come cheap and so these new AI features are expensive to support and need to be paid for. \nThis means that the customer has to pay.\n\nThe outcome of this was that they had to increase the fee they charged their customers. What was previously a yearly fee has now become a monthly fee - a 12x increase just to support the new AI features. This means that instead of continuing with a tool we liked and were willing to pay for we are looking elsewhere as the new AI features are not enough for us to justify paying the additional costs.\nI wonder how many businesses will find that adding these new AI features will not be the golden future they are looking for and will in fact have the opposite effect?\nLinks\nNo feature\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/thecostofai/","title":"The cost of AI"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/thefirstpicturesfromspace/":{"body":"It turns out the first pictures taken from space were not initially planned.\n\nJohn Glenn was due to fly the Mercury-Atlas 6 mission but it was postponed 10 times. Just before the actual launch he bought a $40 Ansco Autoset camera. It was one of the first cameras to have auto-exposure which was ideal for an astronaut as they would not have to fiddle with the controls.\nHe worked with the engineers to modify the camera so he could use it in space. They flipped it upside down so they could add a trigger and handle to press the button and advance the film. They also spliced two roles of film together so that he was able to take 48 pictures.\nThe article below is well worth a read and includes some of the pictures he took as well as pictures of the modified camera.\nLinks\nHow John Glenn’s $40 Camera Forced NASA to Rethink Space Missions\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/thefirstpicturesfromspace/","title":"The first pictures from space"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/thejoyofreading/":{"body":"I read a lot of books.

This article is well worth taking the time to read as it completely changed my views on where the media industry is heading.  My notes here do not do it justice but will hopefully give you enough to encourage you to read it in full.\n\nInitially the production of media was expensive and the associated actions such as distribution and marketing were too capital intensive for individual artists. This led to the creation of distributors such as music labels and film studios. They were able to perform these actions for multiple artists. At this point distribution became the most powerful player in the value chain. \nAs technology improved it meant the cost of creation and distribution plummeted and led to an increase in available content. The number of artists exploded and it became more difficult for new artists to become a success and stand out. Back catalogue sales now make up most of the music industries profits. \nThe bottleneck has shifted from the middle of the chain (the distributors) to the very end - consumer attention. The power is now with the aggregator-distributor and curator; those who convince people what to watch and listen to.\nInfluencers will become the main controllers and will drive consumption based on their recommendations. Celebrities have a head start in this and may be able to leverage this to create even larger fame, followings and influence.\nThe social media platforms are the enablers of this change and they will add the ability to pull content from multiple sources, leading to collections that are always changing, paid subscriptions and buy buttons to purchase physical products directly from recommendations. This is just the start.\nSimilar to the streaming services, the most successful influencers will start commissioning content themselves. Subscription add-ons to access a curated environment will become common. Brands may try to resist this new world but will eventually find they have to follow this path.\nInfluencer based distribution will become key for content creators and brands. \nLinks\nAge of Abundance: How the Content Explosion will Invert the Media Industry\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/thepowerofinfluencers/","title":"The growing power of influencers"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/thereismoretoit/":{"body":"Growing up I was a big fan of Jean-Michel Jarre.\n\nAs a family we travelled all the way from Devon to London to see his Destination Docklands concert in the pouring rain.

When we don’t see a problem, we can’t solve it.\n\nA problem could be hidden in a complex process or has many moving parts. It could be that we don't know we have a problem as we have nothing to compare it with or our expectations are wrongly set. An example might be along the lines of, we are getting poor fuel economy from our car however as we have nothing to compare it with we don't realise and so don't address it.\nAssuming we can identify a problem, how can we make changes to address that and then measure the success of them?\n\nTo succeed upstream, leaders must: detect problems early, target leverage points in complex systems, find reliable ways to measure success, pioneer new ways of working together, and embed their successes into systems to give them permanence.\n\nThe next barrier highlighted is one of ownership. We might identify an issue but we need buy in from those parties that could address it. This can prove difficult sometimes as they may not be the ones that directly benefit from the solution. It could be that they see increased costs or more resources required but they are not the beneficiary of the improvement. It is difficult for them to justify their involvement even though there could be a significant impact.\n\nThis lack of ownership is the second force that keeps us downstream. The first force, problem blindness, means: I don’t see the problem. (Or, This problem is inevitable.) A lack of ownership, though, means that the parties who are capable of addressing a problem are saying, That’s not mine to fix.\n\nThis can be addressed by trying to answer the following questions:\n\nPaying for upstream efforts ultimately boils down to three questions: Where are there costly problems? Who is in the best position to prevent those problems? And, how do you create incentives for them to do so?\n\nThe last question is probably the key and the hardest to answer, especially if the owner of the problem gains little from the results. We might need to identify other ways that they can benefit.\nThe last barrier is referred to as tunnel vision.\n\nWhen people are juggling a lot of problems, they give up trying to solve them all. They adopt tunnel vision. There’s no long-term planning; there’s no strategic prioritization of issues. And that’s why tunneling is the third barrier to upstream thinking—because it confines us to short-term, reactive thinking. In the tunnel, there’s only forward.\n\nI know that if I have a lot on my plate it can become a bit overwhelming to the point of not being able to progress any of the tasks. It is a bit like the study where consumers were given a large choice and asked to pick one. Counterintuitively when a consumer is presented with too much choice they are unable to pick one to buy. \nIf we have a whole set of issues to deal with then our brain struggles to cope and it will only focus on one of them. It will take a short term view and not take the wider picture and the whole set of problems into account. This means it can be difficult to produce the optimal solution which requires a broader view.\nWith all that said, focussing on upstream problems can lead to some successes:\n\nAt the EMS command center in Syosset, New York, there’s a room that looks a bit like NASA’s Mission Control Center. Large screen monitors cover the walls, featuring maps of the areas covered by Northwell EMS. The real-time location of all the ambulances is pinpointed on the maps, and each one is surrounded by a halo that shows the area it could reach within 10 minutes. When a 911 call comes in, the closest ambulance to the emergency is deployed. Then all the other nearby ambulances shift their locations dynamically in order to fill the hole left by the deployed ambulance. It’s an incredibly sophisticated system, and it makes a difference.

It gained fame through the Lean Startup book and the work of Eric Ries.\n\nIt is very easy to focus on the minimum part of the definition. What is the least we can do? It is very easy to forget the viable part - this potentially raises the bar to a higher level. What makes a product viable? What does it need to do? What features must it have to enable the user/consumer to achieve what they want to do?\nOver the past week the world, well the UK at least, has been gripped by the hunt for the Titan submersible that went missing near the wreck of the Titanic. Unfortunately we learnt yesterday that there was a \"catastrophic implosion\" and all those aboard have died.\nThere seems to be a lot of evidence now that the operators of the submersible were focused on innovation and navigating a different path to the more traditional companies. They were keen to innovate and experiment. Unfortunately this approach looks like it cost the lives of five people.\nThere is a time and a place for experimentation; there is a time and a place for processes and certification. I would suggest that in this case they focussed on the \"minimum\" whereas a key \"viable\" feature was the ability to consistently operate safely at a certain depth and to have processes and features in place to either prevent or recover from unforeseen circumstances. The harsher the environment and the more life critical the situation then the more important this is.\nWhen we are developing an application for a mobile, a web application or maybe some types of products the impact of getting the viable part wrong is that the product does not sell or the consumer doesn't engage with the product.

They also asked if we would like to see a video of the dishes. The server then returned with an iPad and proceeded to play a video of some of the dishes, naming each dish as it was shown. This short 30 second video  allowed us to see what the dishes actually looked like, rather than just being a set of words on the menu.\nI am surprised more restaurants haven't taken this approach. I also wonder if you could take this a step further. \nA restaurant could create an interactive experience around their menu which could be accessed from the diners phone. On entering the restaurant they are handed a menu as usual however the menu has a set of QR codes. There is a QR code that takes the reader to a website which has all the dishes. Each dish on the menu also has an individual QR code that takes them to the a page specifically about the dish. This could have details about the dish, a set of photos or a video and also allergy information.\nThe menu itself could present each dish alongside a photo with more information. It could also allow filtering and searching. I could decide that I would like to see all the dishes that have chicken and are medium spicy. Once a dish has been selected it could then suggest dishes that compliment this dish.\nYou could actually build up an order this way as each diner selects their dishes. Maybe it could email a copy of their order to the diner so they can remember what they ordered for next time - or so it could be used to review the restaurant.\nAt the moment, most menus are just a list of dishes with minimal information.

It highlights how driven they both were and also how they stood so far ahead of their peers. It highlights that a lot of the success of the NBA today is down to them.\nThe book interweaves their stories incredibly well and really captures the battles they had together. And due to these battles it covers both their highs and their lows. It is a shame both their careers were impacted by health issues - Magic and HIV, and Larry and his back problems.\nI came away with a new admiration, not just for Magic, but also for Larry - something I wasn't expecting.

I have been listening to it probably longer than any other podcast. He recently interviewed Roberta Arcoverde from Stack Overflow. She talked about how the architecture of the Stack Overflow site is very different from most other large sites in that it is a self hosted monolithic application. \n\nThe most interesting part of the interview for me was not the technical discussion but when she explained that they had considered other options and how they dealt with that. The approach they have is to not immediately dismiss something by saying \"no\" but to instead ask \"why?\" This leads to a discussion about why they should consider the other option and to further research into what is involved. In a lot of cases this still eventually leads to a no but there is detailed reasoning behind that decision. Sometimes it leads to avenues being pursued that would have otherwise been previously dismissed.\nBringing this into real life, my son wanted to buy some relatively expensive trainers. I had previously dismissed this with an immediate no however I decided to go back and ask him why. This led to a discussion about his reasons for wanting them including him actually reconsidering if they were the right ones as he would have to look after them. It eventually led to us buying them with him splitting the cost and investing in looking after them.\nIn the book \"Build\" by Tony Faddell gives another example where why can be used instead of no. He talks about how to deal with passionate leaders who in a \"hurricane\" of requests ask you to do things: \n\nSo here’s how to deal with people like me, how to talk down a hurricane: ask why. It’s the responsibility of a passionate person—especially a leader—to describe their decision and make sure you can see it through their eyes. If they can tell you why they’re so passionate about something, then you can piece together their thought process and either jump on board or point out potential issues.\nFadell, Tony.

Somerset is full of players who are suited to the Hundred and so 11 players missed the one day cup to play in that instead. This meant that all through the one day cup they were effectively playing their second eleven (still good players though).\nAgain. the powers that be decided that rather than have the final at the end of those games they would delay the final until last weekend - over a month since the last game.

I want to focus on a couple of these that involve companies moving away from offices and only coming together when needed.\nI grew up in Devon which is in the bottom left hand corner of the UK. It boasts some of the most beautiful landscapes and beaches in country but has basically no technology companies and limited infrastructure. With the lockdown we started to see people moving to places like Devon or Cornwall when they realised they could work from anywhere. I think things could be taken a stage further and it could, with investment, become a go to place for company \"retreats\"; a place where companies can come together for focussed periods to either build relationships or work on specific problems.\nLet's go on a thought experiment ...\nImagine a large hotel set in rolling countryside that companies can hire for a few days or a week. People automatically start to relax as they drive down the sweeping gravel drive through the trees. \nThe hotel is kitted out with high speed internet and facilities that encourage collaboration and creativity. Accommodation is on-site and is of very high quality. It has world class leisure facilities and a small spa as well as direct access to a beach and the food is world class.\nNot much new so far. These places exist already.\nIt could differentiate itself by facilitating what the companies need: \n\nIt could organise lectures/presentations by world class speakers in various subjects (who are quite happy to speak at such an amazing venue)\nIt has a high end large conference room with the latest technology for whole company meetings/events\nEach meeting room contains the latest technology to encourage whatever they are working on - maybe it includes the ability to record/video the whole meeting with a single switch that is then automatically shared with all the participants?\nAll rooms are carefully designed to promote their use - some for creativity, some for analytical thought, some for collaboration\nIt provides dedicated staff to organise not just everything on-site, with guidance from the company, but also transport to the venue so the company has to do as little as possible to attend\n\nIn addition, other companies could form partnerships with the hotel to showcase their technology. Imagine one of the new start-ups that are working on 3d projections for video conferencing calls being able to host a setup at the venue that the other companies can try for free. It doesn't take many sales to pay back the investment. Or another company showcasing the latest digital whiteboard technology by placing one in each meeting room.\nIn addition to individual companies hiring the property it could also host conferences where the focus would also be on networking and the social side of events. \nWhen it is not booked out by a company or conference it could be rented out either similar to a normal hotel or even as a place for individuals or smaller companies to come use - albeit sharing the facilities with others.\nI know very little about the hospitality industry so have no idea if this would work however if the shift is to companies using more occasional specialist venues for events then the demand should increase. It would not be cheap to run or to hire however it is small compared to the cost of having dedicated offices all year round. Locating it outside the city has the potential benefit of lower costs but does introduce the need to travel.\nCould it work in Devon? The one big issue is travel. It has the countryside and location however it involves significant travel to get there. Maybe losing the beach part would mean that it could happen anywhere in the country where a suitable location with easy access could be found.\nRegardless of whether it could work, the future of work is definitely changing.\nLinks\nTwitter thread\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/workin2030/","title":"Work in 2030"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/posts/workingfromhomeboost/":{"body":"I am fortunate with my current role that I am able to work 2-3 days per week from home.

            <p>Teachers can make a huge difference - in both a positive and a negative way.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>In the book <a href="https://amzn.to/3WLHCgj">Excellent Advice for Living</a> there is a quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To become a hero, thank a teacher who made a difference in your life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was able to do this recently. I had a teacher at primary school called Mrs Tinsley. She was an excellent teacher and I remember I really enjoyed her lessons. At the end of each day she got the class to say a prayer after they had put all the chairs on the tables - and I still remember it to this day.</p>
<p>My parents play for a bowls club and one of their members was also a teacher at my primary school - she wasn't my teacher but she was my brother's teacher for a while. When I was visiting my parents at one point I met her and she mentioned that she had recently met up with Mrs Tinsley to celebrate her 100th birthday!</p>
<p>I was able to pass on my thanks, via this other teacher, for the impact she had on me.</p>
<p>There are a number of other teachers that also had a big impact on me:</p>
<p><strong>Miss Reynolds</strong> - my first teacher at infants school. Apparently, she said even then I would go on to university, which wasn't that common where I grew up at that time. </p>
<p><strong>Mr Morrish</strong> - he was my teacher for my last year at primary school. He also ran the school football team. I really thrived in his classes and loved that year at school.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Bunyan</strong> - my maths teacher for a while at secondary school. He let myself and a friend use the only school computer at the time after school which was stored in a room at the back of his classroom.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Fiddian</strong> - technically not a teacher, but he was a lecturer at Cardiff University and was the person who offered me the place when I phoned up, having to have gone through the clearing process.</p>
<p>And on the negative side there was a maths teacher when I took my A Levels. The grades of <em>everyone</em> in her class dropped over the course of the time she taught them. I will never forget trying to understand a demonstration about vectors that she did using a stool and a pair of knitting needles. To this day I still don't understand what she was trying to show!</p>
<p>Having said that, I have been very fortunate on the whole to have good teachers and I certainly would not be where I am today without them.</p>

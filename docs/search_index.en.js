That’s alarm fatigue, and it’s a critical problem. A group of researchers studied five ICUs (intensive care units), treating 461 patients, for a month in 2013. There were almost 400,000 audible alarms logged in a month, which broke down to 187 audible alarms per bed per day. When everything is cause for alarm, nothing is cause for alarm. As we design early-warning systems, we should keep these questions in mind: \n\nWill the warning give us enough time to act effectively? (If not, why bother?) \nWhat rate of false positives can we expect? Our comfort with that level of false positives may, in turn, hinge on the relative cost of handling false positives versus the possibility of missing a real problem.\n\n\nI had two experiences of alarms during the last week.\nWe were using an office in a large building in Vienna. Suddenly the fire alarm went off. As we were only using the office for the day we checked whether it was a test or we had to leave the building. It was real so we all evacuated - along with hundreds of other people. \nBy the time we were outside the first fire engine had turned up. Within five minutes there were at least another nine appliances present. Fortunately they were able to deal with the situation and we could return after just over an hour. \nThis is an example of an alarm that should always be investigated. They are relatively rare and could involve a risk to life or significant damage to property. Yet, our previous experience of fire alarms meant that there was an element of doubt on whether we needed to act on it.\nThe second experience was at work. We have recently added a new monitoring tool that alerts us if data is missing. This is something that should never happen but if it happens we would like to know about it as quickly as possible.\nThe tool got deployed to an environment and we noticed that it was generating an alert every few hours saying there was an issue and then a short while later effectively cancelling that by saying everything was okay.\nIn investigating the cause we identified that it was due to one part of the workflow not reliably generating all the data required by the next step. This meant that sometimes it would not provide everything needed and hence the tool would generate an alert - even though there was no real underlying problem with the system being monitored.\nIn this instance we were getting frequent alerts of something important but they were wrong. However this meant that we also didn't know when a \"real\" alert was generated as it was lost in the noise. This made the tool effectively useless as this alert would be missed. In the short term we have disabled the monitoring tool while the issue is fixed.\nAlarms are important and useful but there must be a high signal to noise ratio otherwise there is a risk they will be ignored and not achieve their aim.\nLinks\nUpstream: How to solve problems before they happen\nAs an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.\n","id":"https://ilearnt.com/posts/alarmnoise/","title":"Alarms lost in the noise"},"https://ilearnt.com/posts/altcontroldelete/":{"body":"The background to why the famous \"three finger salute\" was chosen to be so difficult to do.\n\nLinks\nThe secret history of Ctrl+Alt+Del\n","id":"https://ilearnt.com/posts/altcontroldelete/","title":"The secret history of Ctrl+Alt+Del"},"https://ilearnt.com/posts/alternativebucketlist/":{"body":"I have never formally made a bucket list.

Somehow I stumbled on one with Daniel Gross. Towards the end of the podcast David mentions his aim to build the largest collection of habits he can.\n\nHe defined a habit as something you do and don't have to think about and gave the example of going to the gym. If he experiments now to find what works for him and makes it a habit, as life becomes busy or changes he can continue it without having to think or make conscious decisions - it becomes easy/easier. So in his world it is a series of experiments to identify the key habits he can incorporate to improve his life with the minimal amount of conscious effort going forward.\nThis made me think about how I could introduce habits or any I already had. \nI tend to be the first person up in the house each morning. I take the time before everyone else appears to catch up on a whole bunch of updates from websites, check the news headlines and most importantly read a section from the bible. For two and a half years I have been reading it every day, only about 10 minutes each time, and I aim to finish it each time at the end of the year. It is something I do every day as part of my routine, a habit.\nFitness would be a good one for me to identify as a habit - definitely an area for improvement.

It helped that I left everything ready next to it so it was as easy as possible to use it however I didn't really enjoy it.

I play walking football, which is much more strenuous than it sounds, however this is just once a week so has some, but minimal impact on my overall fitness. Maybe I will try the bike again but try and make it enjoyable in some way.\nHave a think about what habits you could introduce to build a collection that will improve your life.\nLinks\nDaniel Gross: Dreams and Determination\n","id":"https://ilearnt.com/posts/buildingacollectionofhabits/","title":"Building a collection of habits"},"https://ilearnt.com/posts/butterflyeffect/":{"body":"The butterfly effect famously states that the flapping of the wings of a butterfly somewhere in the world can impact the weather on the other side of the world - a small change can have a huge impact over time.\n\nWhen I was at university a friend was studying engineering and decided to base his project on the impact of chaos. This was in the \"early days\" of the term chaos entering the mainstream. He used measuring a guitar case to demonstrate fractal dimensions, plotted 3d charts of his data and also built a double pendulum to demonstrate chaotic activity. He attached different colour LED lights to it and then set it off in a dark room. With our natural persistence of vision it was a pretty cool effect. He was able to very clearly show that a very small difference in the starting position led to a completely unpredictable outcome.\nThis brings me nicely to a book I recently finished called Upstream by Dan Heath. The theme of the book is making changes upstream of something to impact the outcome. This could be preventative approaches to medicine for example, where preventing a health issue is significantly cheaper and easier than dealing with the health complications further down the line. He also gives other examples including education.\nHe explains nicely how to look at the difference between upstream and downstream actions:\n\nDownstream actions react to problems once they’ve occurred. Upstream efforts aim to prevent those problems from happening.\n\nSolving everything upstream all sounds wonderful however there are a few issues he highlights. \nIt can be very difficult to justify taking an upstream action in some cases as you may not be able to determine what the result would have been without the intervention. This makes measuring the impact of the intervention difficult and in a lot of cases impossible.\nIt could also be the specific actions of one party that make a difference but the benefit is seen by a different party. This can lead to no-one wanting to invest in the upstream action as they will have to justify their investment and the impact it had. It would not be directly of benefit to them.\nOne of the things that ties most cases together is that a potentially small change can have a massive difference further down the line - the butterfly effect again.\nI've also seen this in the business environment. At one company I worked for they had two main departments. Each department had a CTO (Chief Technology Officer). The CTO of our department was not afraid to stand up for what he believed or needed. This eventually led to him being effectively forced to leave.\nThe company then appointed the other CTO as head over both departments. The culture completely changed. I left after about a month but the impact was way more severe. Shortly after I left they had a string of resignations - thirteen people left on thirteen consecutive days. People were discussing with each other which day they were going to resign.\nThe seemingly small change of replacing the CTO had repercussions on that company that took a long time to recover from and also had a massive impact on those remaining. \nThe key takeaway is be conscious of decisions you make, things you say, actions you take - whether in business or life in general - as what might appear to be small could have a massive impact on the future of yourself and those around you.\nLinks\nUpstream by Dan Heath \nAs an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.\n","id":"https://ilearnt.com/posts/butterflyeffect/","title":"The upstream butterfly effect"},"https://ilearnt.com/posts/capturingmemories/":{"body":"A PhD student has created a way to capture conversations with hospice patients that their relatives can play back and listen to at any time later.\n\nIt dawned on me a while ago that a lot of knowledge and memories \"disappear\" when someone passes away.

His whole thing in giving that to me so early was that so many people are so scared to answer that question honestly, for fear that if they don't achieve whatever the answer is, they'll let themselves and those around them down. But if you do have the confidence and the conviction to answer that question honestly, maybe you won't achieve what you set out to, but you'll get really far down the road just for having tried.\n\nThis is quite a liberating, and unnatural way for me at least, way to think. What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail? And if you don't achieve it at least you will have made progress on it.\nI have a side project and I have hit a bit of a roadblock. I need to do a reasonable amount of work on it and at the moment motivation is a little lacking. Part of that is the daunting prospect of achieving what my head is telling me is success - releasing an app and getting lots of people to use it.\nIf I knew I could not fail then I would just plough on and release what I already have then work on it again to improve it.\nHowever there is another way to frame this. Maybe what I need to do is move my definition of success so I cannot fail. Maybe I should set my sights on releasing the app and just getting one person to use it. Given the aim of the application, the most important people for me to use it are my parents and I am sure if I released something they would use it - regardless of how well it works or how nice it looks.\nFor me, this is a much easier target to hit and I know I could do this without failing.\nLinks\nDown A Rabbit Hole with Seth Godin - Simon Sinek/\n","id":"https://ilearnt.com/posts/couldnotfail/","title":"What would you attempt if you knew you could not fail?"},"https://ilearnt.com/posts/crazysocks/":{"body":"This is a great article about a small business that is growing rapidly and run with a smile on their faces.

I was listening to one on creativity and mentioned that creativity is effectively taking existing elements and rearranging them in novel ways. It highlighted that there are two parts to creativity -  creating/discovery and linear/implementation. \n\nThe first mode, creating discovery, involves exploring different configurations. This is the mode when you blue sky new ideas and think about creative solutions. It is best suited to when you are relaxed, potentially even sleepy.\nThe second mode is referred to as linear mode. This mode is a separate state and is suited to the implementation of things - possibly numerical work or learning - where it requires much more focus. This is best suited to when you are more alert.\nMost people transition through these two states of alertness through the course of the day and different people have different times when they are in each mode. Being conscious of your level of alertness means that you can tune when to do different types of work and in turn be more successful as they align with the best mode for your state of alertness.\nFor me, I am most alert first thing in the morning so that is the best time for me to get my head down and get stuff done. In the afternoon I have less energy and so it is a better time for creative thinking. \nWhen is the best time for you for each mode and how could you utilize that?\nLinks\nHow to be more creative\n","id":"https://ilearnt.com/posts/creativitymodes/","title":"Creativity modes"},"https://ilearnt.com/posts/culturalcontributor/":{"body":"When we recruit people we are obviously looking at their ability to perform the role on offer but we are also looking at how well they will work with the team.\n\nWe are very proud of the culture we have created in the team - as an example, two people in the past left and then came back as they couldn't find anywhere else like it. It is so important to us that we have rejected candidates as we didn't think they would fit in with the team and the culture we have despite having the ability to do the role.\nIn the past I would have called this seeing if they are a cultural fit. However a recent interview got me to re-evaluate that, or at least the wording:\n\nThere is such a thing as fitting the culture. But what I love is this terminology of seeing someone as a fit, it absolutely has a pernicious side to it. You are a square. We have a place for a square over here. Square peg square hole. Versus contribution, which is a growth mind set with its contribution, which is we are growing. We're expanding, we're amplifying, and we need whatever it is you have to help us amplify. It goes back to Frank Lloyd Wright, do you fit? Will you be the square peg that I need in this square hole at this moment to serve me? Or are you going to do something that's going to challenge me and make me uncomfortable? Jim Henson, Walt Disney, and look what we can build together that I couldn't do without you. That's,  cultural contribution. I really, really like that for us to think of someone as a potential cultural contributor, rather than a fit.\nWhat you bring that we don't have? How is your voice different? How is your personality different? \n\nI completely agree with this. We want people who don't just fit; they add and contribute to the culture we are building. Evaluating the people we currently have I think that is the case for each of them. They all bring something different - and definitely some bring things others don't (in a good way)!\nIn the book Unreasonable Hospitality the author, Will Guidara, talks about his interview process and how he used to have a structured flow and now uses a more conversational approach. He says:\n\nYou simply have enough of a conversation that you can get to know the person a little bit. Do they seem curious and passionate about what we’re trying to build? Do they have integrity; are they someone I can respect? Is this someone I can imagine myself— and my team— happily spending a lot of time with?\n\nAgain the emphasis here is on culture and personality rather than the ability.\nWe still have some structure to our first interview as there are a set of topics we want to touch on but it forms more of a checklist than a rote series of questions. We aim for the interview to be as much of a conversation as possible with both parties driving the flow. We look for something we refer to as \"the spark\". We want to see their eyes light up when they answer certain things, we want them to be passionate about something and enjoy what they do. They need to be able to communicate well but also have some sense of humour. We want it to be a fun place to work.\nI think the answers to the three questions given above are vitally important and align with our views and how we identify the right candidate. \nLinks\nDesigning the Future with Brian Collins/\nUnreasonable Hospitality: The Remarkable Power of Giving People More Than They Expect/\nAs an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.\n","id":"https://ilearnt.com/posts/culturalcontributor/","title":"Cultural fit versus contributor"},"https://ilearnt.com/posts/culturebehaviour/":{"body":"Andrew Cherrie is the pastor of Home Church. In a recent sermon entitled \"7 lessons from 7 years at Home Church\" he gave the following quote:\n\nThe culture is shaped by the worst behaviour the leader is willing to accept\nHe was particularly referencing the church however it is much broader than this.\nThis observation has certainly shown to be the case where I have worked. Without wanting to incriminate myself, there have been some questionable decisions made by the management in the past which have meant it has been very difficult to hold others  accountable for their later actions when a precedence has been set. \nThe behaviour of some of the people involved has also been questionable. The way they have conducted themselves with respect to both their staff and customers have set a precedence for the culture of the company. It may start with a small infraction but this can quickly lead to larger and larger infractions justified by the previous ones.\nIn the London office where I currently work our leadership team have worked very hard to build the culture. We have tried to build a culture and environment where we would want to work. This has meant that we treat each other as adults, we promote a level of transparency and openness and we always act with integrity at the centre of what we do. We are very conscious of how we act and what we say and the impact it has on others. If any of us see it happening we immediately hold each other accountable and will call it out.\nThis same impact can also happen in the home.

There may be an economic impact, but the link between “hitting the date” and the economic impact will be a lot more subtle and abstract.\n\nIt also provides guidance for determining if a given deadline is real or artificial:\n\nA good question to discern the difference between a real and artificial deadline is to ask how much it will cost if you’re a day late.

It was at least 100 years old and was clearly from a previous era. The décor was a little bit dated and it felt like it could do with a bit of an update. Parking was on the road outside and was tricky to get a space. Hallways were dark and furniture was old fashioned.\nHowever, the staff were friendly, the room was really clean and the location was excellent. And it was relatively cheap. It had some character that you don't get in the modern chains of hotels.\nI definitely would not class it as excellent however as a place to stay it did the job. I would actually recommend someone to stay there in future if they want a cheap, clean hotel in a good location. If they want something special or more modern then maybe not.\nWhich brings me to the question, what makes a good hotel?\nI think there are a few factors - firstly, is it clean? I don't care what level of hotel it is, I expect the room and facilities to be clean - especially nowadays. \nSecondly, does it do what I need? If I just want somewhere cheap to stay then does it work? Is it near where I need to be? Or if I want a romantic place to stay does it meet expectations? This last criteria changes depending on the role the hotel is expected to fulfil.\nAnd lastly, can I get a good nights sleep? This is a factor of the bed, the room and the noise. I usually sleep really badly on the first night at a hotel. I am a light sleeper so noise has a big impact for me. I always wear earplugs. I want to be able to adjust the room temperature and not having a fan or air conditioning humming all night. \nOh and why do they never seem to put electrical sockets next to the bed so you can charge your phone and use it as an alarm/clock?

I have read most of his books. However he claims he doesn't like the writing process.\n\nI listened to his interview with Adam Grant all about this and one quote in particular stood out. From about 26m29s in he talks about:\n\nResist the urge to tell your friends and family your story. Most of us, me certainly, are driven by a desire for other people to experience the story. If you tell your story to your friends and family, which can also be difficult when they are explicitly interested in asking you, oh, tell me more. Tell me where that sounds cool. Then it satisfies your need for an audience and it saps your will to actually write it. So the best way to combat that is to make a rule for yourself saying like, no one can experience this story in any way other than reading it. So I've got to write it. So you can still give it to your friends like a chapter at a time so you can get that incremental validation that you crave, but don't just verbally tell them the idea.\n\nI think there could be an element of this as well with developing side projects.

It proposes that the role of the manager is not to solve problems, as that is what the employee was effectively employed to do, but to help others solve problems.\nThey suggest as a starting point, sixteen questions that may help the employee solve the problem themselves:\n\nWhat do you see as the underlying root cause of the problem?\nWhat are the options, potential solutions, and courses of action you’re considering?\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages to each course of action?\nHow would you define success in this scenario?\nHow do you know you will have been successful?\nWhat would the worst possible case outcome be?\nWhat’s the most likely outcome?\nWhich part of the issue or scenario seems most uncertain, befuddling, and difficult to predict?\nWhat have you already tried?\nWhat is your initial inclination for the path you should take?\nIs there another solution that isn’t immediately apparent?\nWhat’s at stake here, in this decision?\nIs there an easier way to do what you suggested?\nWhat would happen if you didn’t do anything at all?\nIs this an either/or choice, or is there something you’re missing?\nIs there anything you might be explaining away too quickly?\n\nI really do suggest you read the article to get all the details - there is much more to it than just this.\nLinks\nDon't Solve The Problem\n","id":"https://ilearnt.com/posts/empoweringproblemsolvers/","title":"Empowering problem solvers - not offering solutions"},"https://ilearnt.com/posts/endofanera/":{"body":"\"There's something that the Kop wants you to know\nThe best in the world, his name is Bobby Firmino\nOur number nine\nGive him the ball and he'll score every time\nSí Señor\nPass the ball to Bobby and he will score\"\n\nI have been a Liverpool fan since I was six years old. I ended up supporting them almost by accident. Our family were not a football family but we sat down to watch the 1977 FA Cup Final between Liverpool and Manchester United. Red was my favourite colour so, for some reason, I picked the team playing in white which was Liverpool that day. Liverpool lost 2-1 but my love of football and the team stem from that day. My son is now also a big Liverpool fan.\nWe were fortunate enough to go to Anfield earlier in the season. Unfortunately it was the game Liverpool lost 2-1 to Leeds.\nWhen it was announced that Roberto Firmino and James Milner would be leaving at the end of the season I wanted to get tickets for the last home game of the season against Aston Villa. I tried but couldn't find any. I check a bunch of official sites - the club and partners - but no luck.\nThen one day on the off chance I check one of them again - Sportsbreaks - and they had two tickets available that I quickly snapped up. It included a night in a hotel after the game - the \"Knowsley Inn and Lounge\". \nParking near Anfield on match day is also not always fun so decided to try JustPark for the first time and booked a parking slot on someone's drive nearby. This worked really well and will use this option again in future.\nWe did the Boot Room hospitality directly from Liverpool  for the Leeds match. That consisted of a meal and then tickets at the Anfield Road end. The meal was okay and the seats were okay but it was the only way to get tickets at the time.\nThese tickets we bought gave us hospitality access to the Code Lounge. This included a free drink at half time but there was no pre-match meal. You could buy drinks and a standard burger or hotdog if you wanted. I much preferred this as it was a nicer environment and we didn't need the meal - we were more focussed on the match.\nBefore the match we saw the bus arrive and then Mark Lawrenson, the ex-Liverpool defender and TV pundit, spoke for about five minutes. We then took our seats in the L11 section. Excellent view in line with the goal - quite near to the away fans. They were quite loud but it added to the atmosphere. The seats were padded and so much more comfortable than last time.\n\nAs for the match itself, the atmosphere was really good even if it didn't go as we planned. Villa missed a penalty and then scored. We had a goal disallowed (wrongly according to most of the pundits).\nAfter about 70 minutes Roberto Firmino and James Milner came on for their last appearance at Anfield. The atmosphere went up a notch. About a minute before the final whistle, Mo Salah crossed the ball and Bobby nipped in and finished at the near post. The place erupted. What an incredible way to sign off - \"Pass the ball to Bobby and he will score\".\nIt finished 1-1 so it wasn't quite the complete fairy tale but I was so glad we were there. Something to talk about for years to come.\nAfter the game there was a guard of honour for the four players leaving at the end of the season - Firmino, Milner, Ox and Keita. After that all the players, staff and their families did a \"lap of thanks\" around the pitch. I found that quite emotional - especially the send off the two main players got from the kop.\n\nLeon, my son, has always loved the way Firmino plays and has had his shirt and even a painted picture on the wall of his bedroom. I have always admired Milner due to his whole professional approach to the game and his attitude. He may not be the most skilful player but he is someone who is always giving everything. Both of them thrive from making those around them better - and that for me is such an incredible trait.\nThank you James and Bobby for everything.\nAnd now on to next season ...\nAs a side note, the Google Pixel 7 Pro 30x zoom was pretty impressive.

We have an office and team there and we needed to discuss some aspects of upcoming work.\nWe have a running joke that when we go to Vienna we must eat Apple Strudel, with vanilla sauce. \n\nLast time one of  the others was in Vienna was taken by a friend to have strudel and was given something completely different. His disappointment was immense.\nOn our trip we were able to eat strudel twice. The first time was at a venue (I won't name them) that had good reviews and was one of THE places to eat it in Vienna. It was very ornate with smart waiters and waitresses. With this in mind, our expectations were very high. We were served strudel but these expectations weren't met. It was a little overcooked and lacked flavour. The service was brilliant but the product wasn't as good.\nOur second strudel was at a cafe opposite the Opera House. The strudel here was excellent and exceeded our expectations - which had admittedly been tempered by our experience the previous day. The difference between the two was huge.\nWe also had a running joke about the mysterious \"Gates G\" at the airport in Vienna. We mostly flew British Airways and these would always come into \"Gates D\". This section of the airport was very old fashioned, the food was not great and there was nothing to do. One day we followed the signs to this other area and were greeted by a more up-to-date airport experience.\nDue to the pandemic we had not flown to Vienna for about three years. Unknown to us, until we landed, the dreary \"Gates D\" area had been updated and refurbished. It was now significantly improved. We visited \"Gates G\" for old times sake and found that it was actually worse than this new area now. It is still just an area of an airport and doesn't compare to most others we have visited but our expectations of both had changed due to our previous level of expectations and we appreciated the area much more than we would have done had we visited it for the first time.\nYes, these both might seem like trivial - and probably odd - examples. However it demonstrates the impact that expectations can have on our experience of something. In the case of the strudel, if we had not had it before then we would probably have really liked the first one but we had already set our expectations. For the second one, our previous expectations meant that the changes made impacted how we perceived both areas - one better and one worse.\nThis can happen in all areas of life. We read a good review of something or somewhere and our expectations are high. Similarly, we read a bad review and our expectations are set very low. When we actually experience the item or the place we compare it with our pre-set expectations and our enjoyment of it will be influenced by this comparison.\nA number of times I have been surprised by something where I was not expecting it. In a lot of cases this was due to having low expectations that were exceeded. Going forward, are you setting your expectations too low or, probably more importantly, too high and is this impacting how you enjoy things?\nLinks\nGerstner K. u. K.

In agriculture there is the concept of a fallow year where there is a break from planting crops to allow the ground to recover. We decided we would do the same for our developers - we would take a week where they could work on what they wanted as opposed to the usual tasks in the sprint.

He observed that in a lot of cases the fear of failure is really a fear of judgement.\n\nBased on these two observations you could surmise that maybe one of the things that makes a dream impossible is a fear of judgement. Is the fear of what others may think preventing progress towards that dream?\nPersonally when I was growing up, especially at school, I was driven by a fear of failure. I was scared to make mistakes. I would not question things in class and I would work very hard to ensure I knew as much as possible so there was less risk of being wrong.\nI would not talk to people I didn’t know and I would not take many risks. Some of these things are still part of who I am today. \nTaking this in context with the above, a lot of my fear of failure was driven by what others would think of me - I was always conscious of how they might react to what I did.

We used to do this all in a room with post-it notes - a fairly traditional approach. We would set up 4 areas: Liked, Longed, Learned and Lacked and proceed to plaster post-it notes over the different sections. Once everyone had finished we would organise each section into themes and then discuss and agree actions.\n\nGoing fully remote has obviously meant we need to take a different approach and we now drive it from a shared document we create for each retrospective in Google Docs. Whilst working with the document we are all on a video call to discuss things as they occur.\nThe first part of the document is a recap of any  previous actions - this adds a level of accountability. We discuss each previous action to ensure either someone has done it, it is no longer needed or it is added as a new action. Every previous action should fall into one of these three buckets.\nFor the main part of the retrospective we initially tried using the same four areas but found that sometimes the same comments came up in different sections or it was difficult to determine where a comment should go. To address this we culled this down to just two areas: Liked and Lacked (or To Improve) - i.e. what has gone well and what do we need to work on?\nWe set a timer for 10 minutes and everyone adds bullet points in both sections. A small tip - add a page of bullet points first to each section and encourage people to add in different spots on that list otherwise you get lots of confusion as people try to add in the same place. We also encourage fun comments, which may or may not be directly relevant, as this lightens up the later discussions and helps set the culture of the team.\nAfter about 10 minutes - it doesn't have to be exact - we check if anyone is still adding points. If they are we ask them to let everyone know when they are done.\nOnce everyone has finished we get one person to read through all the \"liked\" bullet points. These very rarely lead to discussions but are important to celebrate what is going well. Regularly it will highlight the result of a change from a previous retrospective.\nSomeone else will read through the \"lacked\" list next. If any points need clarification this is the time to raise those questions to ensure everyone understands what each one means.\nIf there appear to be themes, or the list is long, we reorganise it into group to make the next stage simpler. Often the same point will be raised in different ways and this means they can be merged together.\nEach team member is allocated three votes. Over the next couple of minutes they add their votes to the points that they think are most important and need to be discussed. They must use all three - if they only see one or two things they want to discuss they can add multiple votes to a single item (although this rarely seems to happen).\nOnce this is complete we order them by the highest number of votes. If there is a draw in the number of votes then either ask the team to order them. \nWe take the highest voted item and discuss it for up to 10 minutes. If at the end of that time the discussion is still on-going we ask the team if we want to carry on with this item. If so, we ask the same question every 5-10 minutes. \nOnce that item is complete, we pick up the next item and keep repeating until we run out of time.\nAs actions are generated we capture them at the end of the document. Every action should have a person against it - this is key otherwise actions don't happen as no-one takes responsibility. Occasionally we have items that apply to the whole team and we will mark the action with \"team\" rather than just leaving it blank as it seems to add a level of accountability and they are all answerable to each other. Ideally we still have one person own it to ensure the action gets handled.\nAn example document, including votes in the \"lacked\" section:\n\nWhen we started it would take up about 90 minutes and the \"lacked\" list was much longer than the \"liked\" list.

He highlights that he didn't see wireless having such an impact and making most of that work redundant - and this is from an expert in predicting the future.\nIn our house the room I work in is at the front of the house but the physical broadband connection comes in at the back of the house. I considered in the past getting an ethernet cable installed however the concrete floor downstairs and the way the house runs made this virtually impossible without considerable effort and cost. I now have an excellent wireless mesh setup in the house and that idea is relegated to history.\nThe same can be seen sometimes in software. We engineer for a future that we never have to support. I am not saying it is a bad idea to design well or include a level of planning however we often design and develop features or performance that will never be hit.

However they realized this was down to a different generational mindset.\n\nThis was highlighted when I was walking behind two teenagers recently and they just took random arbitrary pictures of themselves as they were walking.\nThey view photos as disposable. There is basically no overhead to taking hundreds of images - it is just point at something (ideally including themselves) and click the button as many times as they like. They also have huge numbers of  filters that can then be applied to tweak it in various ways.\nThose of us brought up in the age where photos were taken on film have a different mindset. When we took photos there was a cost involved - it cost money to develop the photos and also there were limited photos available to take on each film. We had to spend time thinking about the photo we were about to take before pressing the button.\nIt appears that this mindset has continued for a lot of people into the modern digital era. Despite the low overhead, we still take the time to compose the shot before taking it.

Something is new and exciting but before too long it becomes the normal and we are no longer excited by it. It seems to be part of our nature.\n\nHe refers to a section in a book by Tom Holkenborg where he talks about how to “continuously build on that anticipation of what comes next,” \n\nEvery time the DJ drops a new track, it feels louder than anything else that you’ve heard before, which is actually not the case! What happens is you drop a new track, and then over the course of three to five minutes, you make it ever so slightly quieter. And then the new track comes in and it’s back at the level where the original one started, and then everything feels so loud.\n\nIt would be interesting to try this as a way to maintain excitement - dial down the use or interaction with something over time and then use it again after a while. Will we get a level of excitement back again? \nCould this observation be used in education in some way to maintain focus and interest? Maybe the structure of the lesson could be changed so that it effectively gets gradually \"quieter\" and then louder when the next piece of information/learning is introduced. A lesson then becomes a cycle of new information that continuously engages the learner.\nHe also mentions \"We tend to think a lot about what we do, but we rarely think about the order in which we do it.\". This is a really interesting observation and he calls out self-education as one area that can be impacted by this. This could also potentially be applied to the approach above - could changing the order of learning or the type of presentation of learning change the overall result?\nSoftware development went through a phase where the focus was writing the tests before the code which for some people made a huge difference. Agile development also shook up the order things were done - not waiting for the full design and architecture to be complete before starting the development.\nWhat other areas could be impacted if the order of doing things was changed? \nLinks\nDJing on the hedonic treadmill\n","id":"https://ilearnt.com/posts/gettingquieter/","title":"Getting quieter to get louder"},"https://ilearnt.com/posts/githubssh/":{"body":"Just a reminder of the starting point for setting up SSH with Github so I don't have to keep looking for it each time.\n\nLinks\nConnecting to GitHub with SSH\n","id":"https://ilearnt.com/posts/githubssh/","title":"Setting up Github SSH"},"https://ilearnt.com/posts/givingsecondchances/":{"body":"Sometimes people need a second chance.\n\nIn the Simon Sinek interview with Leland Melvin they talk about giving a second chance to an employee and how they can sometimes turn out to be the best employee.\n\nAre you good at giving other people a second shot? Sometimes the disenfranchised that don't get the first shot because of whatever situation that people see them in. And that's probably one of your best employees that they get a shot. You think about second chances. Instead of a firing an employee, you give them the second shot and they're your star because they didn't get fired for doing this thing or whatever happened. They're your best employee.\n\nI have encountered this a number of times in my career.\nWhen I used to run the engineering team for a consultancy a young engineer did something stupid - a prank that he shouldn't have done. We had to decide whether to fire him or give him a second chance. It was not an easy decision and we spent a number of days discussing it and going back and forth. In the end we decided to give him another chance and he would hopefully learn from it. He definitely learnt from it and went on to become one of our best engineers.\nLater in my career I was leading a team of developers at a bank. One of the engineers was really struggling and there were discussions about letting him go (I was not the decision maker). They decided to give him a chance to prove himself. I reviewed every change he made and made suggestions on how they could be improved.\nA lot of people would take this the wrong way and see it as constant criticism. To this person's credit (and he should take all the credit) he used it to learn and took everything on board. Slowly over time his code improved and he required less and less guidance. I left the project after about eighteen months and he is still there today - over a decade later.\nI was also given a second chance. When I started out as a consultant I was working for a customer and I didn't get on with the project manager. It was purely down to a difference in cultures. I went to my boss and said I couldn't continue to work there (I was young and naïve at the time). He knew the project manager and was surprised at my issues. The boss of the company I was working at told my boss that I should be fired but he persuaded her to give me another chance.\nI went back to work there and in the end I got on really well with the project manager, once I understood the differences, and he was actually a really nice guy. I stayed with the consultancy for a couple of years and then my boss and I went off and started our own consultancy - which would never of happened if I had not been given a second chance.\nSometimes something someone does, or does not do, means a second chance is not possible however look for opportunities for people to have that second chance.

This was based on a podcast with Will Guidara where he talked through how he got his restaurant, Eleven Madison Park, to be voted the number one restaurant in the world by focussing not just on the food but the overall experience.\nIt started when he overheard some guests say the one regret of their food visit to New York was not experiencing a \"dirty water hot dog\". He ran out, bought a hot dog from a street vendor and persuaded his chef to serve it to the guests, explaining he didn't want them to leave New York with any food regrets.\nThe reaction he got was the most amazing he had ever seen about food and it only cost him $2. It came from him listening and then acting to make their experience memorable.\nHe learnt from this and encouraged his team to look for these opportunities. However the servers also had their normal role to perform so they added a new staff member whose sole role was to help them create these experiences:\n\nWe decided that it was important enough to invest resources to make it happen more frequently. And so we added a position to the restaurant. Someone whose only job was to help bring other people's ideas to life. So we called the position the dream weaver. I wanted people who are helping to weave dreams for people, to give people memories. People don't collect stuff anymore. They collect experiences and I wanted to create a position that could help us give people memories that would last a lifetime because if you don't have those, then is the experience even worth collecting. I think this is where leaders fall short.\n\nIn this video he gives examples of some of the experiences they have created. A couple came in to console themselves after their beach vacation was cancelled. The restaurant turned the dining area into their own beach with sand, folding chairs and a kids pool of water they could dip their feet into. For a family of four from Spain, the kids saw snow through the window for the first time, so the restaurant hired a chauffeur driven SUV, drove them to Central Park so they could play in the fresh snow.\nThe side effect of this was that not only were the guests happier but the team were as well. They had a chance to create and execute their own ideas.\nThe key is not treating people as a commodity but as a unique individual - look for opportunities to connect, make things special and memorable. And remember it can something small - it started with a $2 hot dog.\nLinks\nUnreasonable Hospitality \nThe Secret Ingredients of Great Hospitality | Will Guidara | TED - YouTube\nUnreasonable Hospitality with Will Guidara podcast\nAs an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.\n","id":"https://ilearnt.com/posts/goingaboveandbeyond/","title":"Going above and beyond"},"https://ilearnt.com/posts/goodstrategy/":{"body":"I've had this book a while but never got around to reading it properly. One of my colleagues at work was listening to the audio version of it and recommended it. This was an excellent read and very relevant to what is happening at the company I am working at at the moment. For me the key takeaway was that what most people call strategy is not actually strategy but vision or goals. Strategy is setting a direction and what needs to happen to achieve it. The observations about the approaches of Walmart and Cisco were particularly good.\n\nMy key highlights:\n\nGood strategy works by focusing energy and resources on one, or a very few, pivotal objectives whose accomplishment will lead to a cascade of favorable outcomes.\n\n\nThe core content of a strategy is a diagnosis of the situation at hand, the creation or identification of a guiding policy for dealing with the critical difficulties, and a set of coherent actions.\n\n\nA great deal of strategy work is trying to figure out what is going on. Not just deciding what to do, but the more fundamental problem of comprehending the situation.\n\n\nGood strategy is not just “what” you are trying to do. It is also “why” and “how” you are doing it.\n\n\nThe most critical anticipations are about the behavior of others, especially rivals.\n\n\nWhat one single feasible objective, when accomplished, would make the biggest difference?\n\n\nWhen a product gives a buyer an advantage in competition with others, there will be an especially rapid uptake of the product.\n\n\nIn my own case, I rely on outside help—I invoke a virtual panel of experts that I carry around in my mind. This panel of experts is a collection of people whose judgments I value. I use an internal mental dialogue with them to both critique my own ideas and stimulate new ones.\n\n\nTo commit to a judgment is to choose an interpretation of which issues are critical and which are not and then to choose an implied action. By committing to a judgment—especially a diagnosis—you increase the probability that you will disagree with some of the assessments of others, and thereby increase the chance of learning something. The same principle applies to any meeting you attend. What issues do you expect to arise in the meeting? Who will take which position? Privately commit yourself in advance to some judgments about these issues, and you will have daily opportunities to learn, improve, and re-calibrate your judgment.\n\nLinks\nGood Strategy/Bad Strategy\nAs an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.\n","id":"https://ilearnt.com/posts/goodstrategy/","title":"Good Strategy/Bad Strategy by Richard P.

Using the weight example, he proposed that the goal should be to reach and stay at a healthy weight. This is both achievable and sustainable.\nSimilarly, having a goal to run a marathon is a one off goal. Having a goal to run a certain amount at a certain frequency is again both achievable and sustainable.\nThis sounds very similar to something called the \"arrival fallacy\". This is the mistaken believe that “When I achieve this goal, then I will be happy.”. There is an element of truth to it in that you will be happy for a short time but numerous studies show that this will only be short lived. There is a lot more detail on this in an article by Ness Labs (see links below).\nThey also highlight that over estimation of our resulting happiness can have an impact on our decision making:\n\nThe impact bias leads to an overestimation of the duration and intensity of the positive emotions you may feel as a result of an event. We overestimate the positive impact the accomplishment of a goal will have, and we underestimate how other events or feelings may influence the way we feel.\n\nThe article suggests that we should change the focus on the process of achieving the goal as much as the result. This includes:\n\nAvoid tying happiness just to reaching the goal\nFocus on experiencing joy at each step on the journey\nCelebrate the small wins\n\nSo from this, maybe the way forward is that we should focus on JAS goals - the enjoy the journey to the goal and make sure the goal is achievable and sustainable.\nLinks\nThe arrival fallacy\n","id":"https://ilearnt.com/posts/jasgoals/","title":"JAS goals"},"https://ilearnt.com/posts/just/":{"body":"It is very easy to make assumptions about a subject you know well and others may not.

He spoke on the subject of \"Last House Standing\" - based on Matthew 7:24-27, the wise and foolish builders.\n\nHe talked about how he had come across articles describing a house in Mexico Beach, Florida, survived Hurricane Michael when the rest of the buildings around it were flattened. This was not luck as the house had been designed and built to withstand the forces that were thrown it. This includes pilings that were driven 40 feet into the ground as well as key design decisions made to minimize the risk of damage.\nHe posed the question \"What has the storm revealed about your foundations?\" This got me thinking about what my foundations are should I be impacted by something substantial. A friend has had to deal with a massive upheaval in his life and you can see how he has been taken right back to these foundations.\nThis house cost about twice as much per square foot to build than the houses around it however it will take significantly less time and costs to fix now the storm has passed.

I usually know it is time to move to a new role if I no longer enjoy it or I am no longer learning something new.\n\nJobWhat I learnt\nSkittlesWhen I was a teenager I set up skittles for 2 local teams. It's a bit like ten pin bowling but with 9 bins and large rubber balls; and my brother and I had the role to replace the pins as they were knocked down each time. For a men's match that could be in the order of 600 in about an hour. I learnt a lot of words I probably shouldn't as well as it is horrible working in a very smoky environment - this was before the ban on smoking in public places.\nFushard DiscoMy brother ran a mobile disco for about ten years and I used to \"roadie\" for him. I learnt that I could lift things heavier than I thought and that testing if a speaker is working by sticking your ear directly in front of it is not a good idea.\nPilton Cabinet WorksEvery Saturday morning for about 8 years I swept up the sawdust and rubbish at a place that made custom handmade high end reproduction furniture. The first week I did it it took me 4 hours and I was paid £3. This later rose to £5 when my brother helped and we shortened the time. We would pick up between 15 and 25 dustbin bags of sawdust.I learnt that sawdust is unpleasant and it can make you sneeze for 30 minutes non-stop (which hurts). I also found out that I could do manual work that was not necessarily fun.\nDe VereWhen I was at school I did a mock interview with a company that made large photographic enlargers. It went so well they offered me a job during the summer. I had to cycle for about an hour each way, up some pretty steep hills, and then spend the day soldering electronics to boards for 8 hours a day.I learnt that I am rubbish at soldering. I had 6 boards to produce. By the end 3 didn't work, one actually caught fire and 2 just about worked. I decided a life in software rather than hardware like my dad and brother was the path for me.\nMarks and SpencerWhile at college I would spend an hour each day stacking the fridges and freezers at Marks and Spencer. I learnt that I am a morning person, that the quickest thing to stack was Chinese style chicken and even in Devon people would fight over which turkey they wanted at Christmas. I also learnt that doing work before college every day impacted my results.\nALSThis was my first real job out of university. This means I learnt a huge amount about what a real job is - the stuff they don't teach you. I also learnt a lot about life. In the job itself the main skill I learnt was to debug programs. When I started there we would make the changes on a very old PC and then have to blow the software on to something called a \"prom pack\". This was effectively burning it onto a chip. This was then inserted into a terminal where we could then test the changes.It took between 15 and 30 minutes from the point you completed the change to when you could see the results. This was also before the days of real debuggers so we had to rely on interpreting the code as we looked at it and random print statements. There was an art to tracking down issues and it taught me well for my subsequent career.\nHISHIS was a consultancy that covered a number of industries. I was an introvert and to step into a consultancy role was a massive step and one I forced myself to do. I learnt how to cope with very steep learning curves when placed regularly in different roles and also the confidence and people skills required to be a consultant. It certainly didn't happen overnight but it had a huge impact on me personally.\nAtrialThis was the first company I was involved in starting. Four of us started it and grew it to about 40 people before a change in the market caused it to implode. I learnt how to pick up programming languages and sectors very quickly (I programmed in about 10 different languages). I also became the engineering manager for all the technical staff so I had to learn quickly how to manage people and projects. I gave it my best shot and I did okay but I also learnt that I still enjoyed coding more.\nEvolution/DeticaI joined a consultancy in the city. My first project was a placement as a Sharepoint expert where I hadn't even used it a week before. The project was a success but it was a huge challenge. I did a number of projects there for various financial institution so I learnt about working in finance and the city.\nBluecrestI joined a hedge fund and an incredible technical team. The ability of this team was head and shoulders above any I had worked with previously. I learnt so much from a technical perspective about distributed systems and how to scale them. We were using stream processors and column databases even before they had been released to production. I also learned the value of culture and leadership. Towards the end of my time there the CTO left and he was replaced by someone else, who was not up to the job. The culture changed completely and nearly 20 people left within a month or so.\nRBSMy first role as a contractor so there was everything related to that that I learnt. This was my first real encounter with a \"pure\" agile project with pair programming, test driven development, retrospectives etc. so I learnt about the good and the bad of this approach. I am glad I had this introduction as it was a good learning exercise but also allowed me to form my own views on what does and doesn't work.\nEndelecAnother startup only this time very short lived. We tried to develop a ground-breaking product for a customer but were undermined by some unbelievable office politics. I learnt that sometimes people are more concerned with their \"empires\" than the overall good of the company.\nCredit SuisseI was involved in developing a front end for a risk platform. This involved developing a data grid pretty much from scratch as the requirements could not be met at the time by existing options. I learnt that sometimes it is better to change the requirements than try to meet them - it became too complex and unwieldy and a simpler solution would have been better - although it did sort of work. I also learned about the impact of stress when it took a toll on my manager at the time.\nMorgan StanleyWith this role I was one of a team of four. Within about six months I was left on my own to support a trading desk completely without any support. I learnt that it is a huge responsibility and you have to learn every aspect of the system to a high level. I learnt that every change needs to be checked multiple times and also that you can earn the respect of traders (well some of them).\nBNP ParibasThis was one of my least favourite roles. There was a lot of red tape and very little trust. You had to check in and out every day and make sure you did a set number of hours and the IT support team wielded all the power which meant development was very difficult.\nMorgan StanleyBack at Morgan Stanley I was the technical lead for a front end for a trading platform. The biggest thing I learnt here was that helping someone learn can make a huge difference. I was able to mentor and teach one of the more junior developers. I won't take full credit for it as a lot of the success came down to this developer having the right mindset to learn and take advice on board.\nCIBCThis was my first real encounter with a web front end project. I was taken on to do a Windows front end and between accepting and starting they changed direction. It was okay but I was unable to convince them to use a web framework that has subsequently been shown to be more successful and easier than the one they picked as I didn't have enough relevant experience to influence the decision. I learnt that sometimes you might end up in the wrong place but you can still make an impact and do your best.\niov42And now to my current role. I have learnt a lot about architecting large distributed systems. I have learnt a huge amount about company/team culture and the importance of it. I have learnt a lot about managing engineers and projects and also a lot about start-ups and the do's and don'ts of running them.

If my learning is aimed at personal development or maybe a business I am working on then reading a book or watching something without taking the action needed to backup that learning could potentially be classed as \"just entertainment\". \nWith this type of subject matter, where there is a purpose behind it, there is an expectation that what is being learnt should be put into action to benefit from it.\nHowever a lot of it is just learning for fun - maybe learning about a subject that I didn't know much about  or covering something that maybe useful one day.

One type of asset we support is what we call a \"unique asset\" - it is an asset that has a unique value. This could be a painting, a car or, in the case of this document, a horse. \nIn the world of computing, it is a running joke that one of the most difficult tasks is naming things. Developers can spend a long time choosing what to name something. We also see this in the world of products and business. There are companies that specialise in helping others name things.\nAnyway, back to the document. When the document was written the horse used in the examples needed a name. In a moment of inspiration that would have a ripple effect, he was named \"Trevor\". From this point on, every example of a unique asset involved \"Trevor the Horse\" and it set a precedent for future, internal, documentation - it was okay to add humour and make it fun.\nSince then we have had a document about structured assets written in the style of Star Wars where every example has a Star Wars theme. We have also had a document about rotating cryptographic keys written as a fairy tale. There is serious content that needs to be communicated but the addition of these elements made them more readable and definitely more fun to write.\nWhen we submitted a tender for potentially a large piece of work, one of those on the call was filmed clapping very excitedly.

A decision is made at a point in time about the features to develop, how long they will take and the order they will be done.\nAt the beginning when the roadmap is made there is incomplete information. There is little knowledge of what will be involved or how the product/market will develop. So assumptions have to be made when not only defining the tasks but also the priorities. It does not take into account the fact there is uncertainty in how features will develop and their priorities may change. Tasks could take longer or the market could change and these will impact the roadmap.\nThe roadmap is presented to all the stakeholders and often set in stone. Once this happens it can be difficult to change.\nA wider audience can make it more difficult to change as there is an expectation and possibly a series of dependencies. This is the reverse of the scenario where people are overcoming an addiction or taking on a new habit. In these cases they are encouraged to include a wider audience as a level of accountability. This wider accountability of the roadmap restricts the flexibility to adjust the tasks and the order they will happen.\nHe highlights that when implementing the roadmap there can also be a level of guilt in terms of having to do stuff that has been placed on it and putting off more important work. This will depend on the flexibility of how the roadmap is followed.\nHe proposes the idea of options as features that may or may not be implemented but the decision is made one cycle at a time. This leads to a level of flexibility in that the most important option can be selected when there is the most relevant information. This implies that you can always pick up the most important/relevant task each time.\nI think the ability to pick options over a roadmap is dependent on the product being developed and the stage it is at. If the product is relatively mature and the options are short and easily defined then there is more scope for following this approach. If the features are larger and have dependencies outside those developing the features then the flexibility is reduced.\nI think there is an opportunity to get the best of both worlds by defining roadmaps but holding them loosely and making sure all the stakeholders understand that it gets regularly reviewed and is expected to change. Regular reviews and an expectation of change can benefit all involved as the stakeholders know that if things change then the features they are dependent on have the opportunity to move up the roadmap and be delivered earlier.\nThe company I work for has just defined a roadmap for the next twelve months. This will give us some direction and focus - something we have been lacking until now. However I completely expect it to change and there is an expectation amongst all involved that when we look back in a years time we will see a significantly different path to the roadmap we have in place now.\nLinks\nOptions, Not Roadmaps\n","id":"https://ilearnt.com/posts/looselyheldroadmap/","title":"The loosely held product roadmap"},"https://ilearnt.com/posts/luminarneo/":{"body":"I am not a photographer.

It is an AI powered application that makes it easy to improve photographs in a few clicks - even for complete novices like me.\nAs an example, here is a photograph I took of HMS Belfast in London. As photos go, it is okay. The sky was grey and so it was not ideal conditions to work with.\n\nBringing this into Neo I made a few simple changes. I was able to change the sky from a dull grey  sky to a blue sky with white clouds in one simple operation. Next I tweaked the lighting, adjusting the exposure, contrast, highlights and shadows. The structure tool uses AI to add more detail and depth to the photograph. The dramatic tool lowers the saturation and contrast. The erase and clone tools were used to remove parts of the photograph that were not needed and may draw the eye. Lastly the colour tool with masking was used to increase the redness of some of the features on the ship.

Together we have experienced some serious ups and downs in the company we work for and also personally. We have each reached a point where we were close to leaving; we have each had something happen in our lives where the others have supported us.\n\nWe used to do this via a WhatsApp group called \"Accountabilabuddies\" where we would not be afraid to commit to things and call each other out. There have been some very blunt chat messages and subsequent conversations triggered by this group. We still do this however we also have a regular, mostly weekly, check in where the three of us make a point to catch up.\nTo drive this we use a simple spreadsheet which has a number of sections that cover our work and the company we work for as well as how we are interacting and how we are each feeling. We call it \"measuring success\".\nWithin each section are a series of columns with statements that we then score between 0 and 5.\nThe company sections currently include: \n\n\"North star\" (the company direction and execution)\n\"Route to market\" (we're a start up, so how we get to revenue)\n\"Sensible sales\" (how well our pipeline is working)\n\"Management team\" (the composition and interactions)\n\"People\" (the right people and how are they)\n\"Communications\" (the effectiveness, audience and frequency)\n\nThese are very geared to the structure of the company, how we work and where we are in our journey. \nOur personal section includes:\n\n\"The Company and Us\" (our interactions with the company)\n\"Our interactions\" (the interactions between the three of us)\n\"Overall\" (how we feel about our role, the company and our work)\n\nThis  is the most useful section and we have regularly called each other out over something having been triggered by these discussions.\nWe will probably review all these sections and questions again soon and come up with new and more relevant topics as our journey and roles have progressed. \nThere are a few things that we have learned from doing this over the past year.\nThree is the magic number\nWe are all working remotely and there are certain limitations due to the logistics of conference calls. With three people we can have a pretty natural conversation where everyone takes part and there is not a lot of talking over people. As the number of people grows on calls it becomes more difficult and also some people tend to take a step back and become less involved. Having been in hundreds of conference calls, three seems to be close to the optimum number.\nAdditionally, as the number of people increases the amount of time taken to review the answers increases. We have found that we can get through reviewing all the answers in about half an hour. We focus on any values that have changed and ask the person who filled it in to explain why it has changed. Sometimes we will add comments on values that haven't changed yet to raise points we think are worth discussing.\nThree people also has the advantage that you don't end up with taking sides and stalemate. It may be that it ends up two \"against\" one in a discussion - and we tend to use that as meaning someone needs to take something on board - however you don't end up with a split with two lots of two people with opposing views. We are always able to reach a consensus.\nOpenness\nI don't think this process would work well unless there is a certain amount of openness and the trust between those involved to say what needs to be said. We each know that what we say is in confidence but also is meant with the right heart - there is no maliciousness and it is always meant as positive feedback. \nWe may try this soon with some of the engineers who work at the company and it will be interesting to see how well it works and if they have the same success and the same openness. It may take a while for them to benefit and I am not sure every single person will buy in but it will be interesting to find out. We would also certainly come up with a different set of questions and sections.\nTrends\nRecently my scores for my enjoyment of my role had dipped. This was due to a number of factors - some down to me and others down to external company factors. The other two were able to see this trend, highlight it and we discussed it. My role was tweaked a little and my enjoyment improved. As my role had changed over time I hadn't seen how it had impacted my enjoyment as I was too close to it and the change was gradual. I am thankful that they picked up on this and we were able to address it.\nThere are lots of \"company surveys\" out there but I am not sure how successful they are. They tend to be aimed at larger groups and don't always lead to discussions. We could role something like that out for the whole company or the whole team however as mentioned above, there needs to be a level of discussion and openness. The people taking part need to feel their answers will be taken seriously and that they can answer how they want - they don't have to worry about how they might be interpreted or how it will reflect on them.\nI am currently thinking how we could use a form of this with the team and this might consist of breaking them up into groups of three. There will probably need to be some serious thought around the questions and also how we can build the trust and openness. If we can pull it off then I think the benefits could be huge however it is certainly not a given. The team we have are very open to trying things and if they work then great and if they don't we either tweak it or throw it away. This could be one of those scenarios.\nCould you find two people to do this exercise with? \nCould you identify key areas in your life that you could measure?\nMaybe you could measure (and build) success too - whatever form that takes.\n","id":"https://ilearnt.com/posts/measuringsuccess/","title":"Openness, discussions and success"},"https://ilearnt.com/posts/meetingasynchronicity/":{"body":"Every couple of weeks we have a meeting called \"FriYay\". Based on a rota, each department has the opportunity to own one of these and present what they are celebrating.\n\nSometimes it becomes more of an update on what a department has been up to however it serves the purpose of keeping those not directly involved with them up to date with what they have been doing. It is a chance for a department to share their successes with others - not bragging, just enjoy sharing.\nFor me, one of the other main reasons for it is a chance for everyone to see everyone else. It is not always about what is presented but it is the few minutes of social banter at the beginning or the few people who stay on at the end to chat when it is over. It is seeing the faces of colleagues who are part of the same company but you have no other work reason to catch up with.\nIn these times where we are working remotely it is important to sometimes have that face to face interaction with others.\nA couple of my colleagues have proposed an alternative approach where a tool like Loom is used to pre-record the presentation. This would replace the FriYay call and people can watch it at a time that suits them.\nThere are a number of advantages to this as it means people can watch the update at the best time for them - for example, they don't have to interrupt their flow to attend the meeting. It also means they can potentially watch it speeded up so it takes less time.\nNow, I am not a meeting fan - I try to avoid them if my attendance is not fully required - however I am not completely sold on this fully asynchronous approach. For some meetings it may make sense but for others, the interaction of people is sometimes as important as the message. Admittedly, if your role involves you being on calls or meetings all day then you are getting a lot of interaction however not everyone has that sort of role.\nIt was suggested at one point to move our team stand-ups to this approach where the engineers could record their progress at any point in the day and post their updates. I pushed back on this as we don't have a lot of meetings/calls and for me the interaction of those involved is a massive part of the reason for the stand up.\nAs part of the stand up, we introduced a weekly question on Monday which gives each team member the chance to share their views or opinions on something. One of the team will pick the question and share it. These have included questions about life, about those involved, about opinions - it is a chance for people to share a little bit from outside work - a chance sometimes to be a little bit vulnerable.\nI certainly would not propose every meeting be done asynchronously, mainly for the reasons I have given above but there may be some types of meetings where it makes sense. \nOne proposal is to also use this approach for another meeting which is mostly a leadership update. It routinely consists of each person presenting about their department and they run one after another. This could be an example where this could be done completely asynchronously and the leaders could meet up just to discuss the important stuff and make decisions. I know at least two people involved in the current approach who are keen to make this happen.\nIt will be interesting to see how this develops. Maybe I will change my mind ...\nLinks\nLoom\n","id":"https://ilearnt.com/posts/meetingasynchronicity/","title":"Should meetings be asynchronous?"},"https://ilearnt.com/posts/meetingcosts/":{"body":"We had a meeting recently with 16 people on the video conference call.

I knew that I would struggle to be productive in each of them if I turned up for them unprepared and had to switch subjects each time. \n\nTo solve this I created a simple document and added a heading for each meeting. Under each heading I made a simple bullet list of everything I wanted to cover or possibly discuss in the meeting. In just over 10 minutes I had planned for all my meetings that day. \nAt the start of each meeting I open the document and as the meeting progresses I strike through each item (alt-shift 5 in Google Docs). I also add additional notes as it progresses. By the end I can see if there is anything I have missed and still need to cover. Once the meeting is over I cut the meeting notes and paste them at the bottom of the document - so not only do they help me in the meeting, I now have an archive of all my meeting notes.\nI now start my day by reviewing my calendar and making notes for any meetings I have coming up.

And I'm thinking, ok ... some of the smartest people in the world in this field wrote this paper. It got through the standards of our top journal, and you a second year student think it's garbage. What's going on here? I think we have a culture where you learn that you signal your intelligence by tearing other people's work apart. And I think it often takes much greater intelligence to build an idea than it does to destroy it.\n\nI think the quote above could be extended to \"it often takes much greater effort to build something up than it does to destroy it\". A classic example is building - it can take months to build a building and only moments to knock it down.\nEarly in my career I would be very critical when reviewing other peoples code - not of them directly, but of the code they produced. It wasn't me consciously trying to show my intelligence but looking back in hindsight there may have been an element of that - a need to justify my role. At the time the motivation was to ensure the code was as good as possible but I guess it could have been seen in another way.\nWe see this to an extent in the media, certainly the British tabloid press. It is much easier for them to be negative and critical of celebrities to sell their papers than to be positive and build them up. \nIt is also said that \"sarcasm is the lowest form of wit\". It can be very easy to make fun of someone in the form of sarcasm. It is much more difficult to say positive things about someone - it takes an effort to step outside some social norms. We can feel uncomfortable telling someone how great they are directly to them.\nFor me one of the turning points was coaching my son's football team. I coached them from the age of 7 to the age of 12. My aim was to always look for the positive in what they did and let them know. It was a conscious decision. If they did something wrong I would always try and put a positive spin on it in some way. I would be looking to encourage rather than discourage. Even now, I find it hard watching youth football coaches who shout at their players, criticizing what they have done even though I am sure the player did their best.\nWith the negative approach it can focus the attention on the person giving the criticism - they are putting down the other party, making themselves look better. With the positive approach it focuses the attention on the party receiving the feedback.\nLinks\nA Bit of Everything with Adam Grant/\n","id":"https://ilearnt.com/posts/negativeintelligence/","title":"Negative intelligence"},"https://ilearnt.com/posts/networkdevelopments/":{"body":"This article documents developments over the last ten years at all layers of the network stack.

If someone makes a mistake we don't blame them but we expect them to learn from it and not do it again. Sometimes it can be very difficult not to blame someone if they do something stupid but don't worry, my team never do that ;-)\nWe had a release recently to a staging environment that had a few issues. The release was made at the wrong point in the code base - it had changes that relied on subsequent changes that weren't included. It would have been very easy to blame the person who made the release. For me, it was more important to identify why and how the mistake happened rather than who made the mistake. In this case, it was clearly an issue with our processes and checks.\nWhilst working on the fix, one of the team reached out to me and explained what they planned to do. I asked if he was just giving me an update or asking permission to deploy it? He explained:\n\nYes, it's our suggestion, but it's better with your green light. So if it catastrophically fails we can blame you.\n\nMy response was:\n\nThat is my main role. Taking the blame for things when they go wrong.\n\nThis was all said in jest but there is an element of truth to this.\nI expect all the engineers to have a level of accountability for the work they do - this helps drive them to do the best they can and be proud of what they do.\nHowever I am not averse to taking responsibility for handling issues when they occur - even if I was not directly involved in the cause of the issue.

We get that rush when either we bring the item home or it is delivered. It is easy to form an addiction to that feeling.\n\nWhen the sales come around we might see something on offer that we think we would like - but had probably not considered before - and this is the time to take a step back and consider whether we really need it. This checklist below is something to consider for the next big purchase, ask ourselves these questions:\n\nCan I work around the problem with a repair, modification, or change in use?\nIf I buy this, what else am I not buying?\nCan I afford this?\nWill this item help me do things I can’t do now?\nWill buying this item significantly increase my enjoyment of X?\nHow often will I use this in the next year? In the next five years?\nWill this item become obsolete in the near term?\nIs this item repairable?\nDo I really need ‘the best’? What is a good second choice?\nCan I buy something used that will do the job?\nAm I supporting a business I know and like? Do our values align?\n\nTaken from this article: Buy less, do more with good enough gear.\nTaking each of these questions in turn, let's expand the thinking behind them ...\nCan I work around the problem with a repair, modification, or change in use?\nIt is very easy when something goes wrong to have the reaction to just bin it and replace it. This especially can be the case if it is technology based and the technology has moved on. It is very tempting to just get the latest new thing.\nI had this when my mobile stopped charging. I was very tempted to buy a new mobile to replace it however a quick trip to the local repair shop resolved it (and they did it for free). Even more recently the camera on the same phone failed. After lots of investigation it turned out to be a known issue with no fix other than to send it back to manufacturer. Due to my reliance on the mobile for work and also the potential cost I decided this time to buy a new one.\nWe now keep that mobile as a backup in case one of our other mobiles fails in future and we need an interim mobile while it is being fixed - a subtle change of use.\nIf I buy this, what else am I not buying?\nThis is the classic case of deciding if there is a better use for our money or could we buy something else instead which we need more? Most of us have a finite amount of money to spend on things and we can only spend it once. It can be very tempting to buy things we like rather than the things we need. Sometimes we need to take a step back and consider is this the best thing we can buy?\nCan I afford this?\nProbably one of the most important points. It is easy to buy something we can't afford if we have access to a credit card or we are offered some form of financing. The lure of delaying the payment or paying it back in small amounts can make the decision to buy easier but does not necessarily make it right. \nThis can go for small purchases right through to the biggest purchases like a house. In fact it is even more important the larger the purchase. It is tempting when we see a house that we love, or a car,  that is outside the price range we can afford and to justify to ourselves that it is just a little bit more. That is the point where we need to take a step back, try and remove the emotion and consider whether we can really afford it.\nWill this item help me do things I can’t do now?\nIs the item we are about to purchase just something that allows us to do something we can already do or is it something that will add something new to our life? And is it something that we really want to do?\nWill buying this item significantly increase my enjoyment of X?\nThe key word in this question is \"significantly\" and can also refer to much more than just enjoyment. Most purchases will give a short term high and may give some form of benefit such as doing something easier or quicker, however does the amount of benefit you gain justify the price and the purchase?\nI am currently considering upgrading the monitor for my computer. I would love to go for a 4k curved monitor however can I really justify that the purchase provides a significant enough benefit?\nHow often will I use this in the next year? In the next five years?\nThis is definitely something worth considering. \nIf we were to buy a new car and it was going to cost us 200 (pick the currency of your choice) per month then that may or may not sound like a lot depending on our circumstances. If we add in all the extra costs like petrol, maintenance, insurance and road tax then it may end up nearer 300 per month. \nHow may times will we use it in a month? Even if we use it every day that works out about 10 per day ... is that a justifiable cost per day given the amount we will use it?\nIf we are considering buying the latest gadget - how many times will we use it in the next year? How many years will it last and so how much will each use cost over the lifetime of the gadget? This reframing of the cost may give some pause for thought.\nWill this item become obsolete in the near term?\nThis is particularly relevant to the latest technology. If we buy the latest iPhone when will we deem it to be obsolete and feel the need to replace it? Will it actually be obsolete or is it just the case that we feel that is obsolete due to peer pressure or feeling the need to have the latest version?\nIs this item repairable?\nAn item being repairable is something that is very easy to overlook and not high on most people's list of decision making lists. However if we want to get value for money, and especially in current times, maybe it should be a major factor. Making a decision based on how easy it is to repair could have a significant impact on the lifetime cost of the item. This could be the cost of replacing a broken screen on a mobile or the cost to repair a car, depending on the choice we made these can differ massively. \nDo I really need ‘the best’? What is a good second choice?\nWhen purchasing something do we really need the top of the range choice or the absolute latest version? Would a cheaper or simpler option be sufficient? This is a decision that will need to be made with the head and not the heart.\nSimilarly, we need to consider the impact of taking the cheapest option as this may be cheap now but add up to higher costs, or not solve our needs, over the course of its lifetime.\nCan I buy something used that will do the job?\nIt is very tempting to always buy new. As an example, I love to read so I have shelves stacked with books. It is easy to go on to Amazon and buy a new book. For books that have been out for a while I now buy them second-hand. I try and pick the best quality I can get for a reasonable price and it means I am saving loads.\nSimilarly, do we really need that car to be new or could we pick up a better deal buying second-hand or nearly new?\nAm I supporting a business I know and like? Do our values align?\nThis was not a conscious step in my decision making process however it is something I think I considered subconsciously in some circumstances. There are some companies I will avoid due to their actions or their ethos and this has skewed my decision making in the past. Maybe this is something that will grow in importance going forward as we become more and more conscious of the world around us and the impact we are having on it.\nSummary\nAnd just to finish ... the aim is not necessarily to say yes to every single one but to be able to take a step back and be more considered when making purchases. And if when you come to make the purchase you feel uncomfortable in some way then it is probably for a reason and you might want to just take a moment to consider before going ahead.\nLinks\nBuy less, do more with good enough gear\n","id":"https://ilearnt.com/posts/pausingbeforebuying/","title":"Questions to ask yourself before you buy"},"https://ilearnt.com/posts/perplexityai/":{"body":"I have tried to avoid writing about AI as everyone seems to be doing it however I have found one site that is pretty usable and actually seems to work quite well.\n\nperplexity.ai is billed as an AI search engine where you can ask it questions in plain English and it will then offer options for further questions based on the answer given.\nI've used it to look at potential places to visit in Croatia and which university my daughter should consider choosing for a psychology degree.\nThe answers aren't perfect by any means but I do like the way it proposes follow up questions to drill into more detail or take the session in different directions.\nIs it a game changer?

It started as an organic process as we found the best way to do this and then developed into a repeatable process for the latter functionality.\n\nBefore starting on the individual breakdowns we produced a list of things to consider for everything we were estimating. This mostly consisted of a list of functional requirements like logging, testing, documentation, etc. as sometimes these can have a significant impact on the work.\nThe first step was to break down the work into \"EPICs\". For us these are the deliverables to the business. At the completion of each of these we should be able to demonstrate a significant piece of functionality.\nFor each of the EPICs we then generated high level user stories and also acceptance criteria at the EPIC level. We set in stone that we could not move on to generating the backlog of tasks and estimates until the whole team agreed on both of these. These could be revisited if needed if the next step revealed any changes were required.\nOnce these had been agreed we discussed the tasks involved in each of the stories. If the story was small enough we would not break it down any further at this point however we would still agree what would be involved in the implementation and make note of any important points.\nFor larger stories we broke these down into smaller tasks. In most cases this created three to four tasks.\nThe next step was estimation. The team decided that they wanted to use story points. To achieve this we went through the process of looking at the work we had done previously and identifying tasks that took a similar amount of work and were differing sizes relatively to the rest. \nWe identified three tasks for each of 1, 3 and 8 story points. When we get to estimating these provide a way to compare with what is being estimated and gauge relative size.\nFor the estimating itself we used a Slack plugin called Pokerbot with Fibonacci story points. This actually worked really well. For each task every developer would use this to vote in secret. We displayed the comparison tasks while voting was done.\nAt this point we also reminded them to consider the earlier list of things to consider.\nOnce all the votes had been cast we used the following rules:\n\nWe only accept a vote with adjacent scores (only 1's and 2's, only 5's and 8's, etc.)\nIf there are non-adjacent scores, start by asking the small outliers \"what work is involved?\" Then ask the large outliers \"what [other] work is involved\"? And then do a revote for the whole team.\nIf you have adjacent scores, but 2 or more are the higher number, take the higher number.\nIf you have adjacent scores, but only 1 of the higher number, they get to choose between the two numbers.\nFor the question mark option: Use it sparingly, but it lets someone ask a question and force a revote\nInfinity: Something's gone wrong. It's the wrong work, or can't be done.\n\nWe generated estimates for each task and then summed them to produce estimates for each story.\nThe last step is to take these and map them to dates for reporting to management. To achieve this we needed to generate an initial velocity value that will obviously change as the project progresses. \nAs a one off we did this by estimating in days how long some of the tasks would take and then mapping these to the story points to get the initial value.\nThe thing that amazed me most was how much the team bought into the process. Admittedly they are all senior level developers but they fully engaged in all the discussions and the process and, hopefully, we have a much clearer view on what we need to do and much better estimates (we'll see soon!).\n","id":"https://ilearnt.com/posts/planningworkshop/","title":"How to run a planning workshop"},"https://ilearnt.com/posts/podcastswithbookmarks/":{"body":"I listen to quite a lot of podcasts.

Go for a circle around your neighbourhood and arrive back home to your home/remote office! It psychologically marks the start and end of the day.\n\n\nIf you are working from home then the easy option in the morning is to just go straight to wherever you are working and start work. I thought I would try his suggestion, especially as the weather is improving.

This proved much more useful than I expected.

I've not read it yet but I came across a podcast where he was interviewed by Simon Sinek so it piqued my interest.\nWill Guidara took over the restaurant Eleven Madison Park and turned it into the best restaurant in the world. He did this by focussing on the experience, not just on the food. \nThere were a number of things that stood out for me (saved for a later post) but one in particular I will highlight here:\n\nWhat's the difference between service and hospitality? Service is black and white, hospitality is colour. Service is just doing the thing that you do with precision, accuracy, and efficiency. Hospitality is how you make the person who you're doing that for feel. In a restaurant, service is getting the right plate to the right person at the right time. Hospitality is the extent to which you've created the conditions for connection while you're serving them that plate.\n\nService is relatively easy to achieve. It is about doing things right and following processes. Hospitality takes effort - a combination of listening/observing and action - that goes beyond and focusses on the experience. It is about building memories and doing things different.\nThe church I attend have two teams of volunteers focussed purely on people. The welcome team are there, as the name suggests, to welcome people. This starts at the front door and goes all the way through the service and afterwards. People regularly comment on the welcome they get and how they are made to feel at home.\nThe second team is the hospitality team. They provide refreshments after the service and for the volunteers before the service (fresh croissants and sometimes bacon sandwiches). Each week they serve hundreds of teas and coffees. They are aided by a third team - the baking team - who provide home baked cakes and cookies each week.\nThis relatively small act of service, providing refreshments, provides an environment where people are encouraged to hang around afterwards and connect; a chance to discuss and chat rather than rush off.\nThe hospitality team also go the extra mile and live up to their name when there are special events. For mothers day they will decorate the area with fresh flowers, use white tablecloths, have a theme for all the cakes. For recent royal events they have displayed flags and use the colours as the basis for decoration.\nIt is also about the connection when they serve the drinks - looking people in the eye and engaging with them, not worrying about how quickly they need to serve people.\nService can be great but hospitality makes the difference.\nLinks\nUnreasonable Hospitality \nUnreasonable Hospitality with Will Guidara podcast\nRock Church\nAs an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.\n","id":"https://ilearnt.com/posts/serviceandhospitality/","title":"The difference between service and hospitality"},"https://ilearnt.com/posts/sharedmeetingdocument/":{"body":"We have a lot of remote meetings as most of our team work a significant amount of time from home.

This worked really well for this particular meeting. We have decided that for nearly all meetings we will create a shared document with an expectation that all participants will update it as it progresses.

If someone asks me what I do I usually explain that I have been programming computers for about thirty years and I have now moved on to managing a team of developers.

As they become comfortable and more knowledgeable in an area they will naturally gravitate to picking up tasks related to it. The need to deliver as quickly as possible can also drive this as the person who knows most is likely to be the person who can do the work quickest.\n\nOver time this can lead to a situation where knowledge of the project becomes \"siloed\" (isolated) - each person has their own areas of expertise and there is less and less cross-over and sharing of other areas. This leaves the project massively exposed if a person leaves or is on holiday. It can also add delays as tasks on the critical path may hold up other tasks while the person who can do them is working on something else.\nThe team I am currently leading took a different approach. They insisted that people pick up tasks in areas they know nothing about. This was difficult to buy into as a leader who has a project to deliver however we have a culture of try things and if they don't work change them. My concern was a natural one that this would mean that the project would be delivered more slowly.\nIn the beginning of the work it definitely had that effect. Each person was free to choose any task they wanted and were actively encouraged to pick up a completely different task than the ones they had done before. \nProgress was slower and there was pressure to deliver faster. However over time this has turned from being a negative into a massive positive. Every member of the team can now pick up any task which means we are no longer as exposed to people leaving or holidays. Productivity has soared as everyone knows the whole project and can help anyone else with what they work on.\nPeople feel bought in and they feel they are contributing. They can engage fully in all the discussions. There are naturally some areas where someone is stronger however one of the key objectives is to pass on that knowledge so others can get up to speed on it.\nAt the beginning I was definitely sceptical but I am now a complete convert to this approach. It is a difficult sell to the stakeholders however in our case we have been rewarded massively.\n","id":"https://ilearnt.com/posts/spreadingtheknowledge/","title":"Speed up in the long term by slowing down in the short term"},"https://ilearnt.com/posts/standingout/":{"body":"There is a famous quote that asks how you eat an elephant and the answer is one bite at a time. It can be very daunting when attempting something new especially if it is potentially a large task. However it is impossible if you don't take the first step.\n\n(By the way, I am not advocating eating elephants - just to be clear)\nSeth Godin wrote an article recently called \"The 100 hour asset\".  In it he explains that by focusing 100 hours on a rare skill you are likely to acquire it - or certainly to a level more than most. This investment of time would put you well ahead of your peers. The commitment to learn the skill is something most people will not do and by you doing so will give you a noticeable advantage.\nHe then goes on to suggest that you could go a stage further. Investing twenty hours per week will give you one thousand hours of knowledge and put you in a new category. \nThe difficulty for most people is not access to the knowledge - it is the commitment to invest time in acquiring that knowledge. \nSo, is there something you could or need to make a commitment to learn? Is there something that will get you ahead in your career or something that will improve your life in another way? It could be a hobby you have always wanted to take up.\nThe prospect of investing twenty hours in a week is like eating an elephant for most people. However as the quote says, it takes a small bite to get started. \nThere is a training plan called \"Couch to 5k\" which is an exercise plan spread over a number of weeks to get someone from sitting on the couch to running 5km in one go. It does this by starting with very small first steps and gradually building it up over time - it doesn't jump to 5km from day one.\nSo, how much time do you think you could set aside to acquire that knowledge or skill that would make a difference? Maybe you can invest one hour a day or maybe you need to start smaller and invest fifteen minutes. If you can't invest it every day then maybe you can invest thirty minutes every other day or two hours at the weekend. Over time you will hopefully be able to increase this, possibly only small increment at a time.\nWhichever path you take the regular investment of time will build that knowledge and make you stand out from those around you and hopefully open new opportunities. \nSo what are you going to willing to commit to invest in?\nLinks\nThe 100 hour asset\nCouch to 5k\n","id":"https://ilearnt.com/posts/standingout/","title":"Committing time to stand out from the crowd"},"https://ilearnt.com/posts/startingsomethingnew/":{"body":"Most people struggle with the blank page and starting something new.

Loewy had a huge impact on the 20th century with significant designs in multiple areas. He said humans are torn between two opposing forces: \n\nneophilia, a love of new things and \nneophobia, a fear of anything that’s too new. \n\nHe identified that success lies at the intersection of those two tensions. We like things that are surprising as long as they are also to a certain extent familiar.\nThis battle for balance leads to the cycles we see in a number of areas including music, fashion and even baby names. People pick something that is different but still similar to what they know. Over time that pick becomes more popular and in doing so becomes too familiar. People then look for the surprise and pick something that is different but still fairly similar. Over time the original becomes less popular and we get a bell curve of popularity.\nWe see this in so many areas. Software builds on the software before it in terms of interaction and features. It is very rare that a completely new genre or approach is immediately successful unless it builds on an existing paradigm. \nWe see company logos and websites go through these same cycles. Suddenly we get a burst of logos using similar typography or the same shapes. Or we see a load of websites using the same layout or theme.\nWe can hopefully use this to our benefit when designing things - whether digital or physical. We need to consider two main questions:\n\nHow do you balance familiarity and surprise? \nCan you engineer a familiar surprise?\n\nIf we can find that fine balance then we may be onto something special - until it gets replaced by the next big thing.\nLinks\nThe four-letter code to selling anything\n","id":"https://ilearnt.com/posts/surprisinglyfamiliar/","title":"Surprisingly familiar"},"https://ilearnt.com/posts/sweetsmakeadifference/":{"body":"My daughter sometimes works as a waitress at the local Pizza Express. If she has a good night then sometimes she can earn more in tips than her wages (although that is not very often).\n\nIn the book 59 Seconds it quotes an experiment where changing the number of sweets and how they were given affected the tip at the end of a meal.\n\nIn the control condition, diners were unlucky enough to receive their bills without any sweets at all. A second group was given a single sweet. Compared to the control group, this simple gesture of kindness resulted in a measly 3 per cent increase in tips. A third group of customers received two sweets each, and, compared to the control group, gave 14 per cent larger tips. Not bad. However, here comes the really clever bit. In the fourth and final condition, the waiters were asked to present the bill to customers along with one sweet each, then, just as they were turning away from the table, reach into their pocket and quickly hand everyone a second sweet. In terms of sweets per customer, everyone ended up with exactly the same number of sweets as those in the third group. But psychologically speaking, this was very, very different. The waiter had just carried out an unnecessary and nice favour, and, because of that, tipping increased by an impressive 23 per cent. \n\nAnother article claims the following are some of the ways to increase the tip given (I have only picked out the ones that are positive for both the server and the person being served):\n\nIntroduce yourself - Customers tend to tip friendly servers more than they do less friendly servers. \nUse positive body language - One of the most effective ways to look friendly is to smile.\nRepeat the order - people like it when others subtly imitate them.\nGive compliments - receiving a compliment activates the same region of the brain that receiving money does. It also encourages spending.\nBe entertaining - A French study found that giving customers a card with a joke on it almost doubled the number of people who left a tip and increased the average size of each tip. \nGarnished check, please! - writing, and in some situations drawing, on the back of the check increases tips\nCall customers by name - servers got the customers’ names from their credit cards and thanked half of them by name when returning the credit cards and charge slips.\n\nMaybe she should try some of these if she doesn't already do them?

This article is well worth taking the time to read as it completely changed my views on where the media industry is heading.  My notes here do not do it justice but will hopefully give you enough to encourage you to read it in full.\n\nInitially the production of media was expensive and the associated actions such as distribution and marketing were too capital intensive for individual artists. This led to the creation of distributors such as music labels and film studios. They were able to perform these actions for multiple artists. At this point distribution became the most powerful player in the value chain. \nAs technology improved it meant the cost of creation and distribution plummeted and led to an increase in available content. The number of artists exploded and it became more difficult for new artists to become a success and stand out. Back catalogue sales now make up most of the music industries profits. \nThe bottleneck has shifted from the middle of the chain (the distributors) to the very end - consumer attention. The power is now with the aggregator-distributor and curator; those who convince people what to watch and listen to.\nInfluencers will become the main controllers and will drive consumption based on their recommendations. Celebrities have a head start in this and may be able to leverage this to create even larger fame, followings and influence.\nThe social media platforms are the enablers of this change and they will add the ability to pull content from multiple sources, leading to collections that are always changing, paid subscriptions and buy buttons to purchase physical products directly from recommendations. This is just the start.\nSimilar to the streaming services, the most successful influencers will start commissioning content themselves. Subscription add-ons to access a curated environment will become common. Brands may try to resist this new world but will eventually find they have to follow this path.\nInfluencer based distribution will become key for content creators and brands. \nLinks\nAge of Abundance: How the Content Explosion will Invert the Media Industry\n","id":"https://ilearnt.com/posts/thepowerofinfluencers/","title":"The growing power of influencers"},"https://ilearnt.com/posts/thereismoretoit/":{"body":"Growing up I was a big fan of Jean-Michel Jarre.\n\nAs a family we travelled all the way from Devon to London to see his Destination Docklands concert in the pouring rain.

They looked at the way cloud computing virtual machines are connected to the physical ones. They claim that it could cut power consumption by 5.5% and lightening network traffic by up to 70%.\nThe researchers suggest using an algorithm based on seagull behaviour to determine the placement of virtual machines in cloud computing networks. This would ensure efficient data routing and minimal energy expenditure, by imitating the seagull's hunger-driven approach to acquiring food. The computers are analogous to the seagull's prey, which are limited and situated in certain areas.

When we don’t see a problem, we can’t solve it.\n\nA problem could be hidden in a complex process or has many moving parts. It could be that we don't know we have a problem as we have nothing to compare it with or our expectations are wrongly set. An example might be along the lines of, we are getting poor fuel economy from our car however as we have nothing to compare it with we don't realise and so don't address it.\nAssuming we can identify a problem, how can we make changes to address that and then measure the success of them?\n\nTo succeed upstream, leaders must: detect problems early, target leverage points in complex systems, find reliable ways to measure success, pioneer new ways of working together, and embed their successes into systems to give them permanence.\n\nThe next barrier highlighted is one of ownership. We might identify an issue but we need buy in from those parties that could address it. This can prove difficult sometimes as they may not be the ones that directly benefit from the solution. It could be that they see increased costs or more resources required but they are not the beneficiary of the improvement. It is difficult for them to justify their involvement even though there could be a significant impact.\n\nThis lack of ownership is the second force that keeps us downstream. The first force, problem blindness, means: I don’t see the problem. (Or, This problem is inevitable.) A lack of ownership, though, means that the parties who are capable of addressing a problem are saying, That’s not mine to fix.\n\nThis can be addressed by trying to answer the following questions:\n\nPaying for upstream efforts ultimately boils down to three questions: Where are there costly problems? Who is in the best position to prevent those problems? And, how do you create incentives for them to do so?\n\nThe last question is probably the key and the hardest to answer, especially if the owner of the problem gains little from the results. We might need to identify other ways that they can benefit.\nThe last barrier is referred to as tunnel vision.\n\nWhen people are juggling a lot of problems, they give up trying to solve them all. They adopt tunnel vision. There’s no long-term planning; there’s no strategic prioritization of issues. And that’s why tunneling is the third barrier to upstream thinking—because it confines us to short-term, reactive thinking. In the tunnel, there’s only forward.\n\nI know that if I have a lot on my plate it can become a bit overwhelming to the point of not being able to progress any of the tasks. It is a bit like the study where consumers were given a large choice and asked to pick one. Counterintuitively when a consumer is presented with too much choice they are unable to pick one to buy. \nIf we have a whole set of issues to deal with then our brain struggles to cope and it will only focus on one of them. It will take a short term view and not take the wider picture and the whole set of problems into account. This means it can be difficult to produce the optimal solution which requires a broader view.\nWith all that said, focussing on upstream problems can lead to some successes:\n\nAt the EMS command center in Syosset, New York, there’s a room that looks a bit like NASA’s Mission Control Center. Large screen monitors cover the walls, featuring maps of the areas covered by Northwell EMS. The real-time location of all the ambulances is pinpointed on the maps, and each one is surrounded by a halo that shows the area it could reach within 10 minutes. When a 911 call comes in, the closest ambulance to the emergency is deployed. Then all the other nearby ambulances shift their locations dynamically in order to fill the hole left by the deployed ambulance. It’s an incredibly sophisticated system, and it makes a difference. Northwell’s average response time is about 6.5 minutes, compared with a national average of 8 minutes.\n\nIt is also not always about solving the problem, sometimes it is about at least making some difference to the problem:\n\nWith some forethought, we can prevent problems before they happen, and even when we can’t stop them entirely, we can often blunt their impact.\n\nI run a team of software engineers developing a product. This has got me thinking about what sort of problems can we solve by taking an upstream view? It is an exercise I am about to start. It might include preventing certain security issues, adjusting working practices or taking a customer viewpoint and identifying their potential pain points.\nLet's see where it leads - or should that be flows?\nLinks\nUpstream by Dan Heath \nThe Jam Experiment\nAs an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.\n","id":"https://ilearnt.com/posts/upstream/","title":"Downstream to upstream"},"https://ilearnt.com/posts/vscodeanygithubrepo/":{"body":"I came across this tweet and had to try it.\n\nYou can open VS Code in the browser on any github repository by substituting \"github.dev\" for \"github.com\".

The approach they have is to not immediately dismiss something by saying \"no\" but to instead ask \"why?\" This leads to a discussion about why they should consider the other option and to further research into what is involved. In a lot of cases this still eventually leads to a no but there is detailed reasoning behind that decision. Sometimes it leads to avenues being pursued that would have otherwise been previously dismissed.\nBringing this into real life, my son wanted to buy some relatively expensive trainers. I had previously dismissed this with an immediate no however I decided to go back and ask him why. This led to a discussion about his reasons for wanting them including him actually reconsidering if they were the right ones as he would have to look after them. It eventually led to us buying them with him splitting the cost and investing in looking after them.\nIn the book \"Build\" by Tony Faddell gives another example where why can be used instead of no.

It’s the responsibility of a passionate person—especially a leader—to describe their decision and make sure you can see it through their eyes. If they can tell you why they’re so passionate about something, then you can piece together their thought process and either jump on board or point out potential issues.\nFadell, Tony.

I want to focus on a couple of these that involve companies moving away from offices and only coming together when needed.\nI grew up in Devon which is in the bottom left hand corner of the UK. It boasts some of the most beautiful landscapes and beaches in country but has basically no technology companies and limited infrastructure. With the lockdown we started to see people moving to places like Devon or Cornwall when they realised they could work from anywhere. I think things could be taken a stage further and it could, with investment, become a go to place for company \"retreats\"; a place where companies can come together for focussed periods to either build relationships or work on specific problems.\nLet's go on a thought experiment ...\nImagine a large hotel set in rolling countryside that companies can hire for a few days or a week. People automatically start to relax as they drive down the sweeping gravel drive through the trees. \nThe hotel is kitted out with high speed internet and facilities that encourage collaboration and creativity. Accommodation is on-site and is of very high quality. It has world class leisure facilities and a small spa as well as direct access to a beach and the food is world class.\nNot much new so far. These places exist already.\nIt could differentiate itself by facilitating what the companies need: \n\nIt could organise lectures/presentations by world class speakers in various subjects (who are quite happy to speak at such an amazing venue)\nIt has a high end large conference room with the latest technology for whole company meetings/events\nEach meeting room contains the latest technology to encourage whatever they are working on - maybe it includes the ability to record/video the whole meeting with a single switch that is then automatically shared with all the participants?\nAll rooms are carefully designed to promote their use - some for creativity, some for analytical thought, some for collaboration\nIt provides dedicated staff to organise not just everything on-site, with guidance from the company, but also transport to the venue so the company has to do as little as possible to attend\n\nIn addition, other companies could form partnerships with the hotel to showcase their technology. Imagine one of the new start-ups that are working on 3d projections for video conferencing calls being able to host a setup at the venue that the other companies can try for free. It doesn't take many sales to pay back the investment. Or another company showcasing the latest digital whiteboard technology by placing one in each meeting room.\nIn addition to individual companies hiring the property it could also host conferences where the focus would also be on networking and the social side of events. \nWhen it is not booked out by a company or conference it could be rented out either similar to a normal hotel or even as a place for individuals or smaller companies to come use - albeit sharing the facilities with others.\nI know very little about the hospitality industry so have no idea if this would work however if the shift is to companies using more occasional specialist venues for events then the demand should increase. It would not be cheap to run or to hire however it is small compared to the cost of having dedicated offices all year round. Locating it outside the city has the potential benefit of lower costs but does introduce the need to travel.\nCould it work in Devon? The one big issue is travel. It has the countryside and location however it involves significant travel to get there. Maybe losing the beach part would mean that it could happen anywhere in the country where a suitable location with easy access could be found.\nRegardless of whether it could work, the future of work is definitely changing.\nLinks\nTwitter thread\n","id":"https://ilearnt.com/posts/workin2030/","title":"Work in 2030"},"https://ilearnt.com/posts/workingfromhomeboost/":{"body":"I am fortunate with my current role that I am able to work 2-3 days per week from home.

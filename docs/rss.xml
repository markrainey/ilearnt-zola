          <description>&lt;p&gt;Every Monday morning as part of our stand up meeting we ask a &amp;quot;question of the day&amp;quot;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you like about our company that is different from other places you have worked?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you come across a post that is so brilliantly put together you have to share it - and I am not talking about any of my posts. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;samwho.dev&#x2F;load-balancing&#x2F;&quot;&gt;post&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; walks the reader through the different algorithms used by load balancers and the pros and cons of each approach. A load balancer takes requests and splits them between different processes (or servers) that can handle them. It&#x27;s aim is to balance the load between them, hence its name.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was at school they had a building which was mainly for the use of those doing their O Levels (the old name for what is now GCSE examinations). There were only two reasons I would get to go to the building: one was for music lessons as for some reason the music department was located there. The second was to attend the weekly youth night they held for each year group.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been developing a Maui application as a side project and on the whole it has been a fun process. It is still very buggy and there are some pain points however it seems to work. One aspect I haven&#x27;t liked is the size of the build artefacts - they are huge if you have multiple projects.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a Dell XPS13 laptop and it developed this really annoying habit of randomly freezing for a few seconds and then carrying on as if nothing had happened. It quite often happened in the middle of a work call which made it pretty much unusable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I have had lots of  jobs during my life and I think I can identify at least one thing I have learnt at each of them. I usually know it is time to move to a new role if I no longer enjoy it or I am no longer learning something new.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite podcasts is Hanselminutes by Scott Hanselman. I have been listening to it probably longer than any other podcast. He recently interviewed Roberta Arcoverde from Stack Overflow. She talked about how the architecture of the Stack Overflow site is very different from most other large sites in that it is a self hosted monolithic application. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;It is a classic way people start a conversation. Some people meet, they exchange a few pleasantries and then they ask &amp;quot;and, so what do you do?&amp;quot; And each person then takes turns, hopefully if someone doesn&#x27;t just keep talking, explaining what their job is.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Most mobile apps, and websites to an extent, seem to be driven by how much they can get the end user to use or engage with them; the more usage the better. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;There are two camps of people where I work; those who want to return to the office and those who want to remain working remotely. The former group tend to be those whose work involves spending most of the day talking to people (the &amp;quot;business&amp;quot; side of the company). The latter group tend to be those whose work is mostly focussed around thinking - or have family and enjoy the balance this approach affords. I fall into the latter camp on both counts. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Towards the end he made the observation that luck is where preparation meets opportunity. This implies the more prepared you are then the more &amp;quot;lucky&amp;quot; you will be when opportunities arise.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

It highlighted that there are two parts to creativity -  creating&#x2F;discovery and linear&#x2F;implementation. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;In the Alchemist by Paulo Coelho there is a quote “There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.” This ties in nicely with an observation from Gino Wickman in a podcast with Lewis Howes (School of Greatness) recently. He observed that in a lot of cases the fear of failure is really a fear of judgement.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;In the David Perell podcast with Daniel Gross they also talked about forcing functions. They started by discussing why Israel seems to be so strong in the tech industry and whether their unique circumstances may be the cause. They talked about how they approach problems as they are forced to deal with the consequences if they don’t - compared to other nations that try to solve problems as they may be impacted by them at some point in the future.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#x27;s a tip that my remote team does - When you get up in the morning, if you&#x27;re willing and able, try COMMUTING to your home office! Go for a circle around your neighbourhood and arrive back home to your home&#x2F;remote office! It psychologically marks the start and end of the day.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;We recently purchased a Sonos Beam and hooked it up to 2 Sonos Play Ones we already had. It works really well and we are really pleased with it. We expected to mostly use it with the TV but have found ourselves using it more and more to play music. However every few days the Sonos app seems to lose the setup. The TV still works with it but the application does not show the system - this is very frustrating.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;We had been planning to have a large garden summerhouse built for a number of months and we were finally in a position to do so. After a lot of research we decided to engage a local company as we liked the style of building they produced and the price was also competitive. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I work very closely with two colleagues - and have done so for a number of years. Together we have experienced some serious ups and downs in the company we work for and also personally. We have each reached a point where we were close to leaving; we have each had something happen in our lives where the others have supported us.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Quite often I will come across long articles and either put off reading them or just skim through their content. This &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redef.com&#x2F;original&#x2F;age-of-abundance-how-the-content-explosion-will-invert-the-media-industry&quot;&gt;article&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is well worth taking the time to read as it completely changed my views on where the media industry is heading.  My notes here do not do it justice but will hopefully give you enough to encourage you to read it in full.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of sites that claim to be idea generators. Most of them turn out to be just a button you click that slings together a bunch of random words that are meant to then become a prompt to generate ideas.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

These were in the days when the expectation was that we would have explosive growth and the company would &amp;quot;at least double in size every few months&amp;quot;. Unfortunately that is not the way it played out - we are still making good progress but have much more realistic growth plans.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Due to the ongoing COVID situation the team had been struggling to stay focussed and motivated. The inability to go out, the lack of change of scenery and the sameness every day has been taking its toll. To try to address this we actively encouraged them to take time off - which, given the limitations on travel, was less appealing than it normally would be.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of our processes we regularly hold retrospectives. We used to do this all in a room with post-it notes - a fairly traditional approach. We would set up 4 areas: Liked, Longed, Learned and Lacked and proceed to plaster post-it notes over the different sections. Once everyone had finished we would organise each section into themes and then discuss and agree actions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;It is very easy for your work week to become a random collection of meetings - all with different attendees and different agendas. For developers in particular this can cause a huge hit on productivity as their day becomes disjointed and they are unable to stay focussed for the longer periods they need for their work.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;We have a lot of remote meetings as most of our team work a significant amount of time from home. Face to face meetings are much better for some types of meetings - especially workshops and retrospectives. As the level of expected collaboration increases the more it favours face to face interactions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;On most projects there is a tendency for someone involved to become the &amp;quot;expert&amp;quot; in one or more areas. As they become comfortable and more knowledgeable in an area they will naturally gravitate to picking up tasks related to it. The need to deliver as quickly as possible can also drive this as the person who knows most is likely to be the person who can do the work quickest.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;This is one of the scariest videos I think I have ever seen. It is not a horror movie or a thriller - it is a talk about the impact sleep has on the body and in particular the impact a lack of sleep has. This includes increasing the risk of cancer, decreased brain function and reduced immune system. I am seriously reconsidering how I &amp;quot;do&amp;quot; sleep after watching this!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I read a lot of books - a bit less at the moment as I commute less - but still probably more than most people. However there are so many books I would like to read I can&#x27;t read them all. I still prefer to read the full book but sometimes book summaries are useful - either to get the key concepts or as a reminder of what I have previously read.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I was listening to the audiobook for &amp;quot;Questions Are the Answer&amp;quot; by Hal Gregerson and it mentioned an approach used by the X lab at Alphabet nicknamed &amp;quot;MonkeyFirst&amp;quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;There is often a work culture that you should be busy all the time - if you are a programmer you should always be typing and producing code. Programming is a mental process and so requires thinking. Sometimes a little thought upfront saves a lot of pain and work down the line.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;This article uses a really neat analogy with Tetris for illustrating the impact of technical debt. Leaving gaps is akin to leaving technical debt in the code base and makes subsequent changes more difficult or slower to ship.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;We had a meeting recently with 16 people on the video conference call. Due to poor planning and technical issues it took nearly half an hour to decide to postpone the meeting. That is eight man hours wasted - a whole day of work!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>The value of throwing code away</title>
          <pubDate>Thu, 07 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

          <guid>https://ilearnt.com/posts/throwawaycode/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;We had a discussion at work about &amp;quot;throw away&amp;quot; code. One of our developers was very against developing any code that would be thrown away afterwards. He referred to this as a waste. In my view sometimes the biggest gain can be in developing code that is meant to be thrown away. It can be used to try things and, more importantly, learn things that can shape the code that is kept. This article sums it up much more eloquently than I can.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I have used the &amp;quot;5 whys&amp;quot; approach multiple times to get to the root of some question. This article advocates adding a time dimension to the decision. Not only should we consider why we are doing something, we should also consider why we are doing something at a specific point in time. It also twists this around and suggests we should consider &amp;quot;What is the danger of not doing this right now?&amp;quot; - what would we lose or miss?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Nearly every technology that has been developed has been used for both good and bad. Developments that look like they could have a massive impact on civilization have usually also spun off a side effect that has a detrimental effect. This could be the latest technologies such as genetic engineering and artificial intelligence or older technologies such as the automobile.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I read a lot of books and once I start reading a book I normally finish it. This article proposes that it may be more valuable to have a bunch of books that are unread. Not sure I completely buy in to the proposition that &amp;quot;Read books are far less valuable than unread ones&amp;quot; however maybe I won&#x27;t feel so guilty buying a book and then leaving it unread.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I have never been a  fan of performance reviews. It may have been down to the way they were implemented at the places I worked however they never seemed to achieve what they were set out to do. The review would usually consist of going over the &amp;quot;achievements&amp;quot; for the past period and then setting a bunch of artificial goals for the next period. The only time these new goals were actually consulted was in the run up to the next review.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

If you are lucky you end up in a town or city, sometimes you end up in the middle of nowhere. It is amazing how much you can work out by looking at the flora or a random signpost.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a video of a demonstration given by Doug Engelbart in 1968 which is commonly referred to as &amp;quot;The Mother Of All Demos&amp;quot;. In the demo, he demonstrates a lot of technologies for the first time together that are common place today and some which we haven&#x27;t even achieved properly now:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I am fortunate with my current role that I am able to work 2-3 days per week from home. This saves me about 2.5 hours of commuting time per day as well as about £2000 per year.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Took me a little while to get into this book. It starts out in a school where a pupil spots a spaceship from his favourite video game. This then moves on to it being a precursor to an invasion by the aliens from the video game and the game itself was actually put together as training so the players could pilot drones in the war. A slightly surreal concept but pretty well executed. The &amp;quot;twist&amp;quot; with the main characters dad is a bit contrived but overall not a bad read - enjoyed it more as it went along. Not as good as Ready Player One.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I had read a lot of good things about this book and it had sat on my Kindle for a long time. Really enjoyed the first half of the book but thought the second half was more focused on things that weren&#x27;t relevant to me. There were some statements made that were clearly opinions but were stated as facts. Overall a bit disappointing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I found this article to be a very astute observation that it can be all the &amp;quot;little trade-offs&amp;quot; that can add up to cause issues. The article highlights it from the perspective of a leader who can make small decisions, usually around putting something off or taking a short cut, that can add up to impact their work and those around them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;My daughter loves dancing. She was entranced by this (so was I). The effort this must have taken to choreograph and the level of control between both the dancers is impressive.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I love the way this article explains some of the key issues with designing distributed systems and how to solve them. It uses the illustration of a theme park and the rides - very clever and a fun read, which is unusual for a distributed systems article!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t own, and have no intention of owning, a MacBook as I own a touchscreen Windows laptop however this approach to make it support touch is genius. They use a mirror at the top of the screen and some image processing to work out where the finger is. They can determine if the finger is actually touching the screen by whether it is touching its reflection - very clever lateral thinking.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;It is very easy to make assumptions about a subject you know well and others may not. You will have knowledge you have learnt over time that you perceive is so simple or obvious that others should just know it - forgetting that once you too had to learn it. This article sums it up really well with the word ... &amp;quot;just&amp;quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I was due to be paid for some work earlier this month and the payment was from a foreign bank account into my account in GBP. The payment was made two weeks ago but never turned up in my account. After numerous phone calls with my bank and a lot of help from the CFO of the company I am working for (thanks Mario) we eventually managed to locate the payment.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve had this book a while but never got around to reading it properly. One of my colleagues at work was listening to the audio version of it and recommended it. This was an excellent read and very relevant to what is happening at the company I am working at at the moment. For me the key takeaway was that what most people call strategy is not actually strategy but vision or goals. Strategy is setting a direction and what needs to happen to achieve it. The observations about the approaches of Walmart and Cisco were particularly good.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;There seems to be no single clean definition of what &amp;quot;Blockchain&amp;quot; actually means. There are a lot of woolly statements, several of which are clearly either wrong or too narrowly focused. This article goes into some of the different definitions and why they are wrong and then the implications of this from a business but also a legal perspective.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Ubissoft have introduced a tool that &amp;quot;uses AI&amp;quot; to identify potential coding issues when the developer commits code. They claim it can detect a significant number of errors and even suggest solutions in some cases. There will always be some errors that it will not be able to identify, for example where the implementation doesn&#x27;t match the requirements, however this approach could have a significant impact on the amount of time spent debugging. And it should improve over time as it learns more potential errors.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;This story documents one scenario that could happen when the nightmare happens of a massive power cut across Europe. It starts with a number of threads and weaves them well together. It follows an Italian as he realizes it is a terrorist attack on the smart power meters. This destabilizes the power grid which takes down most of the grid across Europe. A second attack targets the power plants. This leads to a power cut across Europe that lasts days and the storyline of how they track down the cause and the perpetrators. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Steve Kerr, the coach of the Golden State Warriors basketball team, took an usual step recently by allowing his players to coach instead of him. He felt that things had become a little staid and wanted to shake things up ... it worked - they won by their highest margin of the season. Sometimes leadership is knowing when to step back.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I was really looking forward to this book as I had listened to a podcast where they explained the ideas behind it. The two authors run a design course in Stanford that gets massively oversubscribed and has a huge impact on those who take it by looking at life as a design problem. The aim is to come up with lots of possible routes for your life that could be awesome and then design a path to achieve one of them. If that doesn&#x27;t work you can use the same approach to look for new opportunities. I have not yet made the time to do the exercises and these are absolutely key to getting the most out of it. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;My daughter loves dancing - always has done - whether it is street, contemporary or ballet. However she faces none of the challenges the dancers (and musicians) in this video face. I won&#x27;t spoil it here ... just watch. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;This is such a simple idea and could potentially have a huge impact if it takes off - cafes and pubs filling up water bottles for free.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Intel have just announced a new set of smart glasses that don&#x27;t look stupid. Admittedly the functionality is a lot more limited that other offerings however these look a lot more normal than them. It provides very limited functionality to display a small red image in the lower part of the wearers vision. Cleverly it also disappears when the user is not looking down.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a very unusual setup for the network for my office. The office is situated a floor above and at the opposite end of the house to where the main router is located. A fully wired connection is not an option at the moment due to concrete floors and limited access to roof voids.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;At the moment I am having to get up to speed on a bunch of technologies relating to &amp;quot;DevOps&amp;quot;. This includes Kubernetes. I borrowed this book from a colleague and read it over the course of two days commuting. It provides a very good high level overview of all the main concepts of the platform. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;On 12th June 1984 I was on a family holiday in the US. We had spent three weeks travelling around Florida and then up the east coast to finally end up in Boston. During the day we had a guided tour of the city and we were told that it was game seven of the NBA finals that night between the Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

John and his dad started a business to sell crazy, fun socks and it has gone from strength to strength. I also like the 5% of sales to the Special Olympics and the socks for charities (watch the video).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

It is &amp;quot;about all the thought that goes into the things we don’t think about — the unnoticed architecture and design that shape our world.&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Derek Sivers highlights an interesting pricing approach in this &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sivers.org&#x2F;pp&quot;&gt;article&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. He was asked to perform at a distant location. When the customer couldn&#x27;t afford the price they suggested reducing the performance time, hoping to reduce the price. Instead of doing the expected he raised his price. His reason was that they were paying for him to get to the location and then do the work where the work was the fun bit. By reducing the time on the fun bit it was less worth him making the trip. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

I used them for my company logo, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sentioventures.com&quot;&gt;Sentio Ventures&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, shortly after they started in 2014!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

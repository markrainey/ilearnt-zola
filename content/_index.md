I love to learn - whether it is from books, websites, videos, podcasts or people. This means I come across a lot of "stuff" every day that I find either interesting, enjoyable or have learnt something from. 

Regularly I will be chatting to someone and I'll suddenly remember something I came across that might be relevant or useful to them - and then you get the classic thought process of "I read that somewhere, now where was it, I remember it was just after another article and it had an image of a tiger at the top" etc.

This is my attempt to capture those nuggets in one place to make them easier to find as well as any additional thoughts or useful things I come across. 

Maybe, if I am lucky, you will might enjoy or learn something from them as well.

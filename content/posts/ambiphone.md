When I am working and need to focus I like to have music in the background.

I have written [before](@/posts/musicToFocus.md) about using brain.fm and the Spotify playlists I use. Recently I came across a free website that seems to potentially do something similar to the former.

[ambiphone](https://ambiph.one) has lots of different options for background noise and music. There are sounds of nature (rain, waves, even a cat purring), people and places (such as coffee shop, heartbeat, rollercoaster?!), various noises and some ambient music tracks. There are also binaural beats that are meant to help with different states of alertness.

These can be combined, so you can have multiple sounds at the same time, and the volume of each can be adjusted independently.

I've not tried it enough to come to any conclusions on how it compares to brain.fm but it will be something I will try. A combination of Beta with one of the music tracks could potentially have a similar effect. Even if it doesn't it is a nice tool for providing some background noise/music.

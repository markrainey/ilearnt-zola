I am dabbling with .NET Maui and developing an application for Android.  Tied to that I have just changed laptop. On my previous laptop I had Windows 11 Pro but the new one has Windows 11 Home.

The emulator runs really slowly without Hyper-V but this is normally only available if you have Windows 11 Pro. I could pay a chunk of money to upgrade but I don't need any of the other features.

This [guide](https://www.makeuseof.com/install-hyper-v-windows-11-home/) provides a way to install just the Hyper-V functionality on Windows 11.

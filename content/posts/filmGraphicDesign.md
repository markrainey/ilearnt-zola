I listen to a lot of podcasts (probably 500+ a year) and one I make an extra effort to listen to every episode is [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/). It is "about all the thought that goes into the things we don’t think about — the unnoticed architecture and design that shape our world."

I was catching up on past episodes and came across one that made me think about a whole area that I had never considered but in hindsight seems obvious that someone needs to do it. The area in question was graphic design in television and films. When most people think of graphic design, myself included, they think of logos and brands and posters however there is a whole different arena as a lot of props need to be designed.

This [episode](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/hero-props-graphic-design-film-television/) discusses all the thought behind everything from calendars to newspapers and even prison escape maps that appear in films. I will never look at a film the same way.

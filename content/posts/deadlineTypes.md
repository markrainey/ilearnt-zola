This excellent article looks at the different types of deadlines and the impact they have. The key point for me, and not something I had seen previously defined, is the distinction between real and artificial deadlines:
<!-- more -->

> *Real* deadlines have a direct (and often large) economic consequence. Not meeting the deadline will seriously jeopardize some future outcome. *Artificial* deadlines don’t work like that. There may be an economic impact, but the link between “hitting the date” and the economic impact will be a lot more subtle and abstract.

It also provides guidance for determining if a given deadline is real or artificial:

> A good question to discern the difference between a real and artificial deadline is to ask how much it will cost if you’re a day late. Or a week late. If that $ is big and immediate then it is real.

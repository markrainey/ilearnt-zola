Derek Sivers highlights an interesting pricing approach in this [article](https://sivers.org/pp). He was asked to perform at a distant location. When the customer couldn't afford the price they suggested reducing the performance time, hoping to reduce the price. Instead of doing the expected he raised his price. His reason was that they were paying for him to get to the location and then do the work where the work was the fun bit. By reducing the time on the fun bit it was less worth him making the trip.

He says "even your pricing can be creatively based on your own philosophy. Question the norms."

Sometimes it is handy to save a webpage for later and there are lots of ways to do it.

<!-- more -->

There are numerous times where somebody has mentioned something, or I have read something, and remembered an article I'd' read recently that would be useful. Now I try and capture those pages so I can find them when I need them.

I am not one for keeping hundreds of browser tabs open just in case I want to spend an hour at some point tracking down a tab I opened three months ago that I might want to read one day. I prefer to save them in one place where I know I can search for them later. In the past I used [Pocket](getpocket.com) but things changed and it didn't work as well as I hoped it would. 

I then came across [Omnivore](omnivore.app) - a free and powerful alternative; you can even build and host it yourself if you are so inclined.

The Chrome browser extension is easy to setup and use - one click and it is saved, no additional popups or messing around entering information. The plugin for Obsidian, which I use a lot, is also simple and means I can capture a page and later make it available alongside all my other notes.

Thoroughly recommend it.

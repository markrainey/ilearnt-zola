I found this article to be a very astute observation that it can be all the "little trade-offs" that can add up to cause issues. The article highlights it from the perspective of a leader who can make small decisions, usually around putting something off or taking a short cut, that can add up to impact their work and those around them.

I have also seen this with technical projects. Sometimes small decisions can cascade through a project and cause massive problems later. These could range from an implementation detail to an assumption to the choice of a technology - at some point they have caused big issues.

So I guess it comes down to being conscious of decisions being made and the fact they can have a much more significant impact further down the line.

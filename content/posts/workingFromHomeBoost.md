I am fortunate with my current role that I am able to work 2-3 days per week from home. This saves me about 2.5 hours of commuting time per day as well as about Â£2000 per year.

A new study from Stanford University has shown that working from home can increase productivity significantly. There is a small proviso that working 100% of the time from home can also have a detrimental effect as it can lead to isolation. 

My experience backs this up - my productivity increases when working from home (start earlier, less distractions) but I do need some work human contact. Video conferencing can alleviate that to a certain extent but there are still things that are better face to face.

**Ann Patchett (novelist): Sneak up on your work**

She starts writing something but agrees with her mind beforehand that it is something she will throwaway afterwards which removes the pressure of producing something good.

**Domee Shi (Pixar): Don't think, just draw**

She draws her ideas, asks for feedback and refines them. The aim being to get her ideas out of her head and on to paper which then generates more ideas.

**Stephen Schwartz (Musicals Composer): Start with the title**

He generates a set of titles and then picks a favourite. This performs the base for his work.

**Thomas Heatherwick (Designer): Decide what not to do**

He looks at what has been done before and aims to do something different. Don't get stuck in a rut of copying what is working already out there.

**Ruben Blades (Sales): Buy a paper**

He buys a paper and looks in the classified ads section. He picks an ad then builds a story around that - for example, a bird cage. What happened to the bird? and so on.

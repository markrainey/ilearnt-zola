We have manuals and guides for the software we use. We have a manual for the car we drive. Why not the house?

The obvious answer to this is that every house is different. A set of houses may be built the same but they diverge once people start to live in them. The book [How Buildings Learn](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0670835153) does a great job of showing how buildings change over time with their usage. It also relates very closely to how software evolves.

This question is asked in the article [Writing Documentation for Your House](https://luke.hsiao.dev/blog/housing-documentation). The author goes on to suggest things you might like to capture, such as:

> - When was this carpet installed?
>- How do I turn off the water mains?
>- What’s the model of my dishwasher again? I need the user manual.
>- Why is the water pressure so high?
>- What company is in charge of my sewage?
>- What electrical circuits are in the house?
>- Are there networking cable runs?
>- What colour _exactly_ is this paint?

I think this a brilliant idea. It is something that can be built up over time. I regularly have to look up the model of a device or consult a user manual. I have to trawl through a bunch of documents to find my water company account number. It would take some time to populate but it is the sort of document that could be built over time - a bit like an FAQ.

Maybe I should start one ...

I have never formally made a bucket list. Sure, there are things I would love to do and some more than others but I have never written anything down.

This [article](https://www.inc.com/john-brandon/why-you-should-create-a-bucket-listin-reverse.html) has a different way of composing this list and the focus is definitely on people. It is basically the following:

_"Imagine you're in a hospital bed, connected to a tube. You have a pen and paper in hand. Would you really list anything about visiting a foreign country or an ocean escapade? Not really. People in that actual situation usually think about loved ones--grandkids, children, their spouses. It's perfectly human. All of those typical bucket list items like going on a cruise have nothing to do with other people, usually. No one puts "have grandchildren" on a bucket list, but maybe it should be the highest rated item."_

It also suggests adding things you may regret not having done but always wanted to do - for example write a book.

Certainly food for thought!

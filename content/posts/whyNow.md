I have used the "5 whys" approach multiple times to get to the root of some question. This article advocates adding a time dimension to the decision. Not only should we consider why we are doing something, we should also consider why we are doing something at a specific point in time. It also twists this around and suggests we should consider "What is the danger of not doing this right now?" - what would we lose or miss?

I will try and bear in mind this approach going forward.

This is quite an amazing [article](https://bert.org/2022/06/02/payphone/) about how someone ended up installing an actual old style payphone in their house. 

<!-- more -->

It takes you on a journey through how credit card numbers were generated, using payphones, and these numbers, to illegally get free Internet access and then leading to later introducing the payphone to their daughter. It then moves on to actually buying and installing an actual payphone in their house that their daughter can ring from another phone that is wired into it.

An excellent fun read and I still have no idea why someone would actually do this!

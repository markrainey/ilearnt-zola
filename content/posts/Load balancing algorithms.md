Sometimes you come across a post that is so brilliantly put together you have to share it - and I am not talking about any of my posts. 

This [post](https://samwho.dev/load-balancing/) walks the reader through the different algorithms used by load balancers and the pros and cons of each approach. A load balancer takes requests and splits them between different processes (or servers) that can handle them. It's aim is to balance the load between them, hence its name.

The article uses simple animated illustrations that show how they each algorithm works and how the messages are distributed to each processing service. Even if you know nothing about load balancing or have no interest in it it is worth a look just to see how a potentially complex subject can be simplified into something clear and easy to follow.

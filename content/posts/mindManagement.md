Being productive is sometimes more about mind management than time management.

<!-- more -->

In the book "[Mind Management, Not Time Management](https://amzn.to/43Xn5bs)" it aims to highlight that sometimes you need to shift your approach to be productive:

> The next time you set out to be productive, ask yourself, What work am I in the mood to do right now? Then, ask yourself, what do I need to do that fits that mood?

This makes sense to me. Sometimes I am in the right creative mood to achieve certain tasks. Other times I am in a completely different state of mind and there is no way I could achieve anything creative - I might be in the space to only get some admin tasks done.

This aligns nicely with the concept of when you are at your most productive. In a previous post I mentioned that I am a morning person. Anything that requires a lot of thought and focus I am best to attack in the morning when I am most alert. More mundane tasks are best left for the afternoon when I am less awake.

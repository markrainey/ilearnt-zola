When I feel I am no longer learning I know it is likely time for me to either look at how my current role can change or time to look for a new role.

Eugene Wei has a great way of phrasing this. He asks whether it is time for him to “renew his novice permit”. He deliberately takes himself out of his comfort zone and looks for a new role where he will become a complete novice again; a role where he needs to learn everything and is likely to make mistakes. 

He highlights that to grow you need to push yourself away from the equilibrium. It is easy to do the same thing day in and day out but you won’t grow doing this. It is easy to be in a role where you know things so well that you rarely make mistakes. He encourages you to look for an opportunity to be the beginner, to experiment and to learn.

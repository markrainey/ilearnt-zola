I have tried numerous to-do applications in the past; from the very simplest to the all-singing, all-dancing applications and they have never stuck. I used them for a week or so and realised a month later that I hadn't used them for a while.

The Microsoft To Do application seems to have hit a sweet spot for me. I have found myself using it regularly to track both my home and my work tasks. It even has a list for potential blog post ideas.

Part of the appeal I think is the east of use and the convenience. I can quickly add or mark off a task from my phone or the desktop application and the list functionality is very simple. Hopefully they won't spoil all this by adding too many features!

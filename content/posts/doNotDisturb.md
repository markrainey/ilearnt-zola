My current role means I work full time from home - which is great. The commute is easier, the food is better and having flexibility is great.

I have a wife and two children, well one of those has just technically become an adult. When working from home there are occasions where I prefer not to be interrupted - especially some calls I need to be on. I looked into a bunch of solutions and ended up with a simple homemade approach that works really well. 

I bought a cheap LED light strip and there was just enough room under the office door to glue it underneath. I can now turn it on using the remote when I am not to be disturbed. My door glows red underneath and those outside can clearly see not to interrupt.

If they really need me then they can still send me a WhatsApp message to let me know.

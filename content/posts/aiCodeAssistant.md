Ubissoft have introduced a tool that "uses AI" to identify potential coding issues when the developer commits code. They claim it can detect a significant number of errors and even suggest solutions in some cases. There will always be some errors that it will not be able to identify, for example where the implementation doesn't match the requirements, however this approach could have a significant impact on the amount of time spent debugging. And it should improve over time as it learns more potential errors.

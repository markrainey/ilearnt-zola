My daughter finishes her A Level exams today. Let's just say she can't wait to get them over and done with. She has worked incredibly hard over the last month or so; in fact over the last two years.

Before some of the exams she has been nervous and worried about the questions that will come up. I will tell her that all she can do is to "do her best". Both my kids will have lost count of the number of times I have told them that.

However I came across an [article](https://boz.com/articles/get-it-done) that extended this in the work environment where you are not the only person who could be involved in a task:

> Too often I see someone who is responsible for accomplishing an important goal doing the best they can in the face of immense odds. It may sound counterintuitive, but the mandate of such a job is not to “do the best you can.” It is to **get it done**. And if the way to get it done is to ask for help, then that’s what you should do.

I like the idea that this now becomes "do your best" or "do our best" where "best" is getting it done. Sometimes we need to ask for help.

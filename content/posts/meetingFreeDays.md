It is very easy for your work week to become a random collection of meetings - all with different attendees and different agendas. For developers in particular this can cause a huge hit on productivity as their day becomes disjointed and they are unable to stay focussed for the longer periods they need for their work.

We started seeing this with the team I am working with. Someone would see a big chunk of free time and schedule a meeting right in the middle of it. It started to feel like everything was revolving around meetings and workshops - and delivery noticeably dropped.

We are about to try having "meeting free" days. Tuesday and Thursday have been set aside as meeting free - unless someone has an exceptionally good reason to break that rule. The team have bought into this and we will see how it goes.

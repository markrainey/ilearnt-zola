Took me a little while to get into this book. It starts out in a school where a pupil spots a spaceship from his favourite video game. This then moves on to it being a precursor to an invasion by the aliens from the video game and the game itself was actually put together as training so the players could pilot drones in the war. A slightly surreal concept but pretty well executed. The "twist" with the main characters dad is a bit contrived but overall not a bad read - enjoyed it more as it went along. Not as good as Ready Player One.

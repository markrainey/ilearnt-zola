I was not old enough to remember the first man on the moon - in fact I wasn't even born until the following year.

I've obviously seen the footage and know the famous quotes but there is a great [site](https://www.firstmenonthemoon.com/) where you can listen to two streams of the original audio for mission control synced with the original video from the lander.

The two audio streams are played independently on the left and right speakers and what is said and who says it is also shown in sync. The video is played in the middle. There is also a timeline so you can jump to the "best" bits.

I expected to just listen to a few seconds but ended up listening to a large chunk of the descent. This was due to the brilliance of the simplicity of the implementation.

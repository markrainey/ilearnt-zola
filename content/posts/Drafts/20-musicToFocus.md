When I am working I like to have music in the background to help me focus. I find, like a lot of people, that it needs to be music without lyrics most of the time.

If I really want to focus or need to be creative I use [brain.fm](https://www.brain.fm/). Many years ago I signed up for a lifetime subscription when it first started. I was initially sceptical of it but I thought I would give it a go. 

I have been pleasantly surprised on the impact it has had. I have found that playing this in the background, with or without headphones, has actually helped me focus on what I need to do. Whether it is just the effect of removing distracting background noise or the claimed science actually works I am not sure but I have definitely found it has helped, especially when I have to write technical documents for work.

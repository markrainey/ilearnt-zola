Sometimes you come across an article that makes you think. The article, [Numbers To Know For Managing Software Teams](https://staysaasy.com/management/2023/03/20/numbers-to-manage-by.html), made me do that.

My daytime role involves ~~managing~~ helping a team of developers to deliver a great product. The article lays out a number of guidelines for how often something should happen. I don't necessarily agree with all of them but it is an excellent thought exercise to look at what you do and come up with your own set of guidelines.

For example,

> 7 - the number of days before a new hire should have merged a pull request

We try and achieve this within 2-3 days.

> 5 - the number of comments on a document before you should ask to talk about the issue

I thought this was an interesting rule of thumb. So much time and effort could potentially be saved by doing this.

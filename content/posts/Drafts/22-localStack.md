I joined [A Cloud Guru](https://acloudguru.com/) for a year and was able to learn a lot doing some of their courses and using their emulator - thoroughly recommend them btw.

This week I came across [LocalStack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack). This allows you to run an emulation of a lot of the AWS services locally on your machine. I've not tried it yet but plan to in the near future.

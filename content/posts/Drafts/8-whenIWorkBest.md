I am a lark.

<!-- more -->

In the book [Time Wise](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Time-Wise-instant-international-bestseller-ebook/dp/B0B6QZ7TNM) by Amantha Imber she discusses the three main types of people and their alertness through various times of the day. It impacts when they are most productive for certain types of tasks. This has been written about in numerous other places but she summarises it really well:

| **Larks**                          |    |
| ------------------------------ | ------------ |
| Deep Work                      | 7 - 10/11am             |
| Shallow / Light Work           | 11am - 2pm |
| Rebound (additional deep work) | 2-4pm             |

| Middle Birds                          |    |
| ------------------------------ | ------------ |
| Deep Work                      | 9am - 12pm             |
| Shallow / Light Work           | 12pm - 2/3pm |
| Rebound (additional deep work) | 3-5pm             |

| Owls                          |    |
| ------------------------------ | ------------ |
| Deep Work                      | 4pm onwards             |
| Shallow / Light Work           | 1 - 4pm |
| Rebound (additional deep work) | 10am - 1pm             |

I am definitely a lark. I tend to wake up early and work best in the morning, sometimes with another burst from middle to late afternoon. 

My wife is probably an owl. She likes staying up late and definitely likes mornings less than I do.

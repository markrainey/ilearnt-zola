From a book I am reading, came across this today (Time Wise):
"So he tried something rather extreme: Price deleted every single meeting from his calendar, accompanied by a note to the meeting organiser that offered one of three options. Option 1 asked the meeting organiser to respond with the purpose of the meeting, Price’s role and responsibility in the meeting, and what specifically they wanted Price to add to it. Option 2 asked the organiser to defend the purpose of the meeting and suggest who from Price’s team could attend in his place. Option 3 suggested that Price or one of his team didn’t need to attend the meeting, or conversely, that the meeting didn’t even need to be held. ‘They’re the meetings that probably shouldn’t exist and they just kind of do. And with this approach, over one-third of meetings just never came back to my diary. The meeting only existed because it existed last year. Because you never kill a meeting, you only ever add a meeting.’ Not only did this strategy liberate much of Price’s diary, but he was also then able to attend the meetings that did remain knowing his exact role and responsibilities. Price reported that simply requesting the meeting organiser clarify his role led to a huge reduction in his cognitive load (not to mention making the time spent in meetings much more efficient and effective). He now knew whether he was there to challenge, contribute, be a provocateur or something else entirely."

Barnes’ rules around meetings and respecting people’s time were echoed in Japan when Microsoft introduced a FDW trial. They had three rules. First, you had to use Microsoft Teams for meetings. Second, no meeting could be longer than half an hour. Third, no more than five people could be invited to a meeting. Productivity went up by 39.9 per cent based on these three rules alone. I suspect happiness skyrocketed, too

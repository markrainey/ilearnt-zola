This is a great description of the difference between an introvert and an extrovert.

In the Simon Sinek [discussion](https://simonsinek.com/podcast/episodes/courage-with-guy-raz/) with Guy Raz he gives the following example of the difference (and credits Susan Cain of Quiet fame for it):

> I love Susan Cain's definition of introversion versus extroversion, which is it's about energy. An introvert wakes up in the morning with five coins and every social interaction they have, they spend a coin and at the end of the day, they're depleted. An extrovert wakes up in the morning with no coins and every social interaction, they have, they get a coin at the end, they feel rich.

I am definitely an introvert. I wake up with energy and every substantial social interaction drains me of energy. I need "me time" to recharge.

I thoroughly recommend the Susan Cain book as well. It is one of those books that you read and think "yep, that's me" and "that too".

I have started using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) a lot. One of the things that I really like is the ability to add community plugins to add functionality as required.

<!-- more -->

These are the plugins I use the most:

**[Advanced Tables](https://github.com/tgrosinger/advanced-tables-obsidian)** 
Add improved navigation, formatting, and manipulation to markdown tables. I've not used this a huge amount but very helpful when doing anything with tables.

**[Doubleshift](https://github.com/Qwyntex/doubleshift)** 
Open the command palette when you press *shift* twice. This is my main way of executing some of the other plugins/commands. Very handy and easy to use.

**[Focus Mode](https://github.com/ryanpcmcquen/obsidian-focus-mode)**
Remove all the extra stuff from the display. I use this if I have a chunk of focused writing to do as it just leaves the note I am working on.

**[Icon Folder](https://github.com/FlorianWoelki/obsidian-icon-folder)** 
Add any custom icon (of type .svg) or from an icon pack to your folder or file. Probably not essential and more of a nice to have as it makes certain folders stand out more.

**[Kanban](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban)** 
Create markdown-backed Kanban boards. This is my go to approach for tasks. I have used it to track things to do and also things to take when travelling.

**[Novel Word Count](https://github.com/isaaclyman/novel-word-count-obsidian)** 
Display statistics about each file and folder. Another nice to have. I use it to display the number of notes in each folder, although it can do a lot more than that.

**[Paste URL into selection](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-url-into-selection)**
Insert links (URLs) into a selected text. Definitely one of my most used plugins. Type some text, highlight it and then paste a url and it will convert it to a link.

**[URL Namer](https://github.com/zfei/obsidian-url-namer)**
Retrieves a web page title to name URL links. This is the reverse of the paste url plugin. I can paste a URL and then execute this and it will pull in the title from the url and convert it to a link.

**[Various Complements](https://github.com/tadashi-aikawa/obsidian-various-complements-plugin)**
Enables you complete words like the auto-completion of IDE. Another plugin I use a lot but without really realising it as it is constantly offering suggestions as I type.

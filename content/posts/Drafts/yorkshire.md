We recently spent a week staying in Yorkshire with another family and their dog. These are my notes and thoughts from the holiday.

# Accomodation

## Eldwick Villa

Hot tub, walks, little things, hosts, hamper, bar, table football/slot machine, quiet

# Food

## The Birches, Eldwick
The pub is located in the centre of Eldwick and has recently been refurbushed. All the staff and the owner are very friendly and helpful. It is also very dog friendly with free treats by the door. It shows sports on two large TVs (with the sound off) however it doesn't do any food other than crisps. After 9pm no under 18s are allowed due to their license.
## Cardamon, Bingley
We had takeaway curry from here. We were told a time it would be ready but it took about 15 minutes longer, even though it wasn't busy. However the staff were very friendly and we chatted to them while we waited. As for the food, it was nice. The Royal Thali was different as it was a serving of four different dishes with rice.
## Brown Cow, Bingley
We booked a table on a Tuesday night for a meal and then to join the weekly pub quiz. The food was excellent - recommend the sausage and mash. As for the pub quiz, unusually it was free to enter. Team size is limited to six people. We entered an adult and a kids team as there were eight of us. The first prize was a Â£25 voucher for the pub - which we won and we were able to use that to help pay for the food. A fun evening with good food and excellent service - really enjoyed it, in a nice pub.
## Kurt's Fish and Chips
As we were on holiday we decided to have fish and chips one night. A quick scan of the reviews and we decided on Kurt's of Bingley - and we weren't disappointed. All the food was excellent - especially the haddock. It was not at all greasy and had probably the thinnest crispy batter we have ever had. And the chips weren't bad either.
## Billy Bob's Diner
Someone recommended we visit Billy Bob's Parlour at Skipton. It is a bit in the middle of nowhere but definitely worth the effort to visit. It is designed to mimic the American diner experience. You can book tables inside, including inside an American school bus, or you can just turn up and take a table outside. As it was a really hot day this is what we did. Service was really helpful and friendly and the food was amazing. The burger was excellent but the star of the show was the ribs - massive portion and superb. The shakes were also good. For younger kids there is also a massive play barn on site. If you are in the area, it is a definite place to visit.
## Dick Hudsons
Another recommendation for somewhere to eat. Dick Hudsons is a nice big pub on the edge of Baildon Moors. They were able to accommodate a group of eight of us and a dog. The food was really good - the penang curry was excellent. The service, by Jess, was also worth mentioning - very friendly, helpful and efficient.
# Attractions/Things to do

## Malham Cove
We visited Malham on the day of the country fayre. If you are into farm animals and various country activities then this would be an ideal day for you. Unfortunately we were not and the miles of traffic jams to get there didn't help. I am sure that on a normal day it will be a lovely place to get to.

We parked in a field and walked through the village - a very nice village but heaving with people. As we left the village we took a path to the right that was signposted to Malham Cove. This was a really nice walk along a path through fields. We reached the cliff face and the water at the end just as there was a cloudburst so we got soaked. Unfortunately on the right hand side of the river there is a limit to how far you can go. If you go back to where there is a wall by the river there is a small bridge you can cross to get to the better looked after path that leads back to the village.

## Skipton
We parked in the car park near the canal, walked across the bridge and picked up an ice cream. The town is nice to wander around  We really liked a shop in the centre called The Snug. This sold paintings and wooden furniture. The owners were also very friendly and we chatted to them for a while - they recommended the places to eat. There is also a shop by the canal that sells pork pies - really nice pies.

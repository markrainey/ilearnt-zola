Part of my current role is prototyping new features and algorithms to determine if and how they will work. It's nice to do some hands on coding still.

However, it is easy to think that prototyping always involves writing code when you work in technology. IDEOU have a nice simple definition of a prototype that emphasises this:

> A prototype is anything that gets the idea in your head into an artifact people can experience and offer feedback on.

I really like this definition as it focusses on the experience and the feedback - not on the solution. Sometimes it can be a quick low-tech prototype that can get the best results.

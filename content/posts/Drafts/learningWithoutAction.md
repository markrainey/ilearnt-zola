Should all learning require an action?

<!-- more -->

I love to learn - I guess you might have worked that out from this blog. I spend a lot of my spare time reading books, listening to podcasts or watching videos. 

I recently watched an interview as part of the "Quietly Influential Summit" - a series of interviews aimed at introverts. And yes, I am an introvert.

In an interview with Jane Travis she said

> Learning without action is just entertainment

I am not sure I agree with this completely although I can understand the viewpoint. If my learning is aimed at personal development or maybe a business I am working on then reading a book without taking the action needed to backup that learning could potentially be classed as just entertainment as there is an expectation that what is being learnt should be put into action - and that is not necessarily a bad thing.

However a lot of it is just learning for fun - maybe learning about a subject that I didn't know much about  or covering something that maybe useful one day. In both these cases there is not necessarily a direct action required but I would also not purely class it is entertainment.

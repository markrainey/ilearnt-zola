[Lex.page](https://lex.page/) was one of the first AI assisted editors available. 

<!-- more -->

I have used it on and off for a few months and for some tasks it is pretty good - with some human intervention. As an example, I took the post from yesterday 

> I have tried to avoid writing about AI as everyone seems to be doing it however I have found one site that is pretty usable and actually seems to work quite well.
> 
> [perplexity.ai](http://perplexity.ai) is billed as an AI search engine where you can ask it questions in plain English and it will then offer options for further questions based on the answer given.
> 
> I've used it to look at potential places to visit in Croatia and which university my daughter should consider choosing for a psychology degree.
> 
> The answers aren't perfect by any means but I do like the way it proposes follow up questions to drill into more detail or take the session in different directions.
> 
> Is it a game changer? I don't think so but it is another tool that might be useful for some tasks.

I then asked Lex to rewrite it for me:

> Perplexity.ai is an AI search engine that offers users quick answers to their questions in plain English. I've used it to research potential places to visit in Croatia, as well as to help my daughter decide which university to choose for her psychology degree. It isn't perfect, but it's a useful tool for any task; it allows users to drill into more detail or take their session in different directions by suggesting follow-up questions. Though it's not a game changer, it may still be beneficial to some.

For me it has produced a pretty good summary but it lacks character. I have used it in the past to rewrite some work and then manually merged bits with the original writing. 

I also asked it to generate some potential title ideas for that post and these were the first five suggestions, which I think are not bad:

1.  Uncovering the Benefits of AI Search Engine Perplexity.ai
2.  Unlocking the Potential of AI with Perplexity.ai
3.  Making the Most of Perplexity.ai: An AI Search Engine
4.  A Tool for the Modern Age: Exploring Perplexity.ai
5.  AI Search Engine Perplexity.ai: An In-Depth Look

I actually decided to use the first one.

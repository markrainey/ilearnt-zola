This is a great [article](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/meet-john-21-year-old-entrepreneur-whose-inspiring-story-will-make-you-cry-tears-of-joy.html) about a small business that is growing rapidly and run with a smile on their faces. John and his dad started a business to sell crazy, fun socks and it has gone from strength to strength. I also like the 5% of sales to the Special Olympics and the socks for charities (watch the video).

Oh and John has Down's Syndrome - an amazing family!

At the moment I am having to get up to speed on a bunch of technologies relating to "DevOps". This includes Kubernetes. I borrowed this book from a colleague and read it over the course of two days commuting. It provides a very good high level overview of all the main concepts of the platform. 
<!-- more -->

As an introduction, which is exactly what I needed, it was perfectly pitched however if I was going to have to get my hands dirty with using the platform in anger then there are probably better options out there. The version I had could have also done with a proof read as there were a lot of typos.

I would recommend this book if you want an introduction to Kubernetes but not if you are going to be using it day to day.

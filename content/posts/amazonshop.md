Using technology it has been able to do away with both of these traditional aspects of a shop and just let customers walk out, having worked out what they have purchased.

Will it revolutionize shopping? I am not sure in the short term as this is some quite impressive technology and I am not sure it scales to a normal shop or supermarket however it has the potential to really shake things up over time - or at least push the incumbent shops to think again.

**[Update]** Ben Thompson (I love his analysis) has an [interesting view](https://stratechery.com/2018/amazons-go-and-the-future/) that Amazon won't license this approach, at least initially, and will use it to build a bigger gap between itself and other retailers. It also highlights why Amazon is such an unusual company in its approach to business and the way it grows.

I recently had the scenario where I had to use up a few days holiday before they would expire. I decided to hire and cottage and go walking. Unfortunately due to a stomach bug this didn't go quite as planned however the other aim was to conduct a life review and assess what I wanted to achieve over the coming year.

I scanned the web and found this article, [How to Conduct an Annual Life Review That Will Catapult You into the New Year](https://schlaf.medium.com/how-to-conduct-an-annual-life-review-that-will-catapult-you-into-the-new-year-d5aaffebac1f). There is also an accompanying [template](<[Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ais6wP0HxoFfvHR9JVkf2sw2ft_EUBtb42JYOr6ObGo/edit)>) you can use to work through it.

It starts by reviewing the last year before moving forward. You assess where you currently are on a number of areas of life and then work out some of your goals. 

It was a useful exercise that took me a couple of hours. I am not sure I identified anything ground breaking that  I didn't already know however it did get me thinking - especially around the health/fitness side.

Intel have just announced a new set of smart glasses that don't look stupid. Admittedly the functionality is a lot more limited that other offerings however these look a lot more normal than them. It provides very limited functionality to display a small red image in the lower part of the wearers vision. Cleverly it also disappears when the user is not looking down.

They have some grand plans for it but I do question whether the limited display provides enough functionality to get users to use it. Then again may be what smart glasses needed was a design that looked normal and provided just enough functionality to be useful.
